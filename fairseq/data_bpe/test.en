When I was little , I thought my country was the best on the planet , and I grew up singing a song called &quot; No@@ thing To En@@ vy . &quot;
And I was very proud .
In school , we spent a lot of time studying the history of Kim I@@ l-@@ S@@ ung , but we never learned much about the outside world , except that America , South Kore@@ a , Japan are the ene@@ mies .
Al@@ though I often wondered about the outside world , I thought I would spend my entire life in North Kore@@ a , until everything suddenly changed .
When I was seven years old , I saw my first public execu@@ tion , but I thought my life in North Kore@@ a was normal .
My family was not poor , and myself , I had never experienced hunger .
But one day , in 199@@ 5 , my mom brought home a letter from a co@@ worker &apos;s sister .
It read , &quot; When you read this , all five family members will not exist in this world , because we haven &apos;t e@@ aten for the past two weeks .
We are lying on the floor together , and our bodies are so wea@@ k we are ready to die . &quot;
I was so sho@@ cked .
This was the first time I heard that people in my country were suffering .
So@@ on after , when I was walking past a train station , I saw something terrible that I can &apos;t er@@ ase from my memory .
A li@@ fel@@ ess woman was lying on the ground , while an em@@ aci@@ ated child in her arms just star@@ ed help@@ lessly at his mother &apos;s face .
But nobody helped them , because they were so focused on taking care of themselves and their families .
A huge fa@@ mine hit North Kore@@ a in the mi@@ d-@@ 199@@ 0s .
U@@ l@@ timately , more than a million North Kore@@ ans died during the fa@@ mine , and many only survi@@ ved by eating grass , bu@@ gs and tree bar@@ k .
Po@@ wer out@@ ages also became more and more frequ@@ ent , so everything around me was completely dark at night except for the sea of lights in China , just across the river from my home .
I always wondered why they had lights but we didn &apos;t .
This is a satellite picture showing North Kore@@ a at night compared to neighbors .
This is the Am@@ ro@@ k Ri@@ ver , which ser@@ ves as a part of the border between North Kore@@ a and China .
As you can see , the river can be very nar@@ row at certain points , allowing North Kore@@ ans to secre@@ tly cross .
But many die .
Sometimes , I saw dead bodies flo@@ ating down the river .
I can &apos;t reveal many details &#91; about &#93; how I left North Kore@@ a , but I only can say that during the ug@@ ly years of the fa@@ mine I was sent to China to live with dist@@ ant rela@@ tives .
But I only thought that I would be separ@@ ated from my family for a short time .
I could have never imagined that it would take 14 years to live together .
In China , it was hard living as a young girl without my family .
I had no idea what life was going to be like as a North Kore@@ an refuge@@ e , but I soon learned it &apos;s not only extremely difficult , it &apos;s also very dangerous , since North Kore@@ an refuge@@ es are considered in China as illegal migr@@ ants .
So I was living in constant fear that my identity could be reve@@ aled , and I would be re@@ pa@@ tri@@ ated to a horrible f@@ ate back in North Kore@@ a .
One day , my worst ni@@ ght@@ m@@ are came true , when I was caught by the Chinese police and brought to the police station for inter@@ ro@@ gation .
Some@@ one had accu@@ sed me of being North Kore@@ an , so they tested my Chinese language abilities and asked me tons of questions .
I was so scared , I thought my heart was going to explo@@ de .
If anything seemed un@@ natural , I could be imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ed and re@@ pa@@ tri@@ ated .
I thought my life was over , but I managed to control all the emotions inside me and answer the questions .
After they finished ques@@ tioning me , one official said to another , &quot; This was a false report .
She &apos;s not North Kore@@ an . &quot;
And they let me go . It was a mirac@@ le .
Some North Kore@@ ans in China see@@ k as@@ y@@ lum in foreign emb@@ assi@@ es , but many can be caught by the Chinese police and re@@ pa@@ tri@@ ated .
These girls were so lucky .
Even though they were caught , they were eventually released after heavy international pressure .
These North Kore@@ ans were not so lucky .
Every year , coun@@ t@@ less North Kore@@ ans are caught in China and re@@ pa@@ tri@@ ated to North Kore@@ a , where they can be tor@@ tured , imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ed or publi@@ c@@ ly execu@@ ted .
Even though I was really fortunate to get out , many other North Kore@@ ans have not been so lucky .
It &apos;s tra@@ gic that North Kore@@ ans have to hide their identi@@ ties and struggle so hard just to survive .
Even after learning a new language and getting a job , their whole world can be turned up@@ side down in an inst@@ ant .
That &apos;s why , after 10 years of hi@@ ding my identity , I decided to risk going to South Kore@@ a , and I started a new life yet again .
S@@ et@@ t@@ ling down in South Kore@@ a was a lot more challenging than I had expected .
English was so important in South Kore@@ a , so I had to start learning my third language .
Also , I realized there was a wide gap between North and South .
We are all Kore@@ an , but inside , we have become very different due to 6@@ 7 years of divi@@ sion .
I even went through an identity crisis .
A@@ m I South Kore@@ an or North Kore@@ an ?
Where am I from ? Who am I ?
Su@@ dd@@ enly , there was no country I could prou@@ dly call my own .
Even though ad@@ ju@@ sting to life in South Kore@@ a was not easy , I made a plan .
I started studying for the university en@@ tr@@ ance ex@@ am .
Just as I was starting to get used to my new life , I received a sho@@ cking phone call .
The North Kore@@ an auth@@ orities inter@@ cep@@ ted some money that I sent to my family , and , as a p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment , my family was going to be for@@ ci@@ bly removed to a de@@ sol@@ ate location in the coun@@ tr@@ y@@ side .
They had to get out quickly , so I started planning how to help them escap@@ e .
North Kore@@ ans have to travel incredible dist@@ ances on the path to freedom .
It &apos;s almost impossible to cross the border between North Kore@@ a and South Kore@@ a , so , ir@@ on@@ ically , I took a flight back to China and I hea@@ ded toward the North Kore@@ an border .
Since my family couldn &apos;t speak Chinese , I had to gui@@ de them , somehow , through more than 2,000 miles in China and then into Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia .
The journey by bus took one week , and we were almost caught several times .
One time , our bus was stopped and bo@@ ar@@ ded by a Chinese police offi@@ cer .
He took everyone &apos;s I.@@ D. cards , and he started asking them questions .
Since my family couldn &apos;t understand Chinese , I thought my family was going to be arre@@ sted .
As the Chinese offi@@ cer approa@@ ched my family , I imp@@ ul@@ sively stood up , and I told him that these are dea@@ f and du@@ mb people that I was chap@@ er@@ on@@ ing .
He looked at me su@@ spi@@ ci@@ ously , but lu@@ cki@@ ly he believed me .
We made it all the way to the border of La@@ os , but I had to spend almost all my money to bri@@ be the border gu@@ ards in La@@ os .
But even after we got past the border , my family was arre@@ sted and ja@@ iled for illegal border cros@@ sing .
After I paid the fine and bri@@ be , my family was released in one month , but soon after , my family was arre@@ sted and ja@@ iled again in the capital of La@@ os .
This was one of the lo@@ west points in my life .
I did everything to get my family to freedom , and we came so close , but my family was thrown in jail just a short distance from the South Kore@@ an emb@@ as@@ sy .
I went back and forth between the im@@ mi@@ gration office and the police station , desper@@ ately trying to get my family out , but I didn &apos;t have enough money to pay a bri@@ be or fine anymore .
I lost all hope .
At that moment , I heard one man &apos;s voice ask me , &quot; What &apos;s wrong ? &quot;
I was so surprised that a total str@@ anger car@@ ed enough to ask .
In my broken English , and with a dictionary , I explained the situation , and without h@@ es@@ it@@ ating , the man went to the A@@ T@@ M and he paid the rest of the money for my family and two other North Kore@@ ans to get out of jail .
I th@@ an@@ ked him with all my heart , and I asked him , &quot; Why are you helping me ? &quot;
&quot; I &apos;m not helping you , &quot; he said .
&quot; I &apos;m helping the North Kore@@ an people . &quot;
I realized that this was a symbo@@ lic moment in my life .
The kind str@@ anger symbo@@ li@@ zed new hope for me and the North Kore@@ an people when we needed it most , and he showed me the kin@@ dness of strangers and the support of the international community are truly the rays of hope we North Kore@@ an people need .
E@@ ven@@ tually , after our long journey , my family and I were re@@ un@@ ited in South Kore@@ a , but getting to freedom is only half the battle .
Many North Kore@@ ans are separ@@ ated from their families , and when they arri@@ ve in a new country , they start with little or no money .
So we can benefit from the international community for education , English language training , job training , and more .
We can also act as a bridge between the people inside North Kore@@ a and the outside world , because many of us stay in contact with family members still inside , and we send information and money that is helping to change North Kore@@ a from inside .
I &apos;ve been so lucky , received so much help and inspiration in my life , so I want to help give asp@@ ir@@ ing North Kore@@ ans a chance to pros@@ per with international support .
I &apos;m confi@@ dent that you will see more and more North Kore@@ ans succee@@ ding all over the world , including the TED stage .
Thank you .
Today I have just one re@@ quest .
Please don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Now I &apos;d like to introduce you to my brothers .
Re@@ mi is 22 , tall and very hand@@ some .
He &apos;s spe@@ ech@@ less , but he communic@@ ates joy in a way that some of the best or@@ ators cannot .
Re@@ mi knows what love is .
He shares it un@@ condi@@ tionally and he shares it regar@@ dless .
He &apos;s not gre@@ e@@ dy . He doesn &apos;t see skin color .
He doesn &apos;t care about religious differences , and get this : He has never told a lie .
When he si@@ ngs songs from our childhood , attemp@@ ting words that not even I could remember , he re@@ minds me of one thing : how little we know about the mind , and how wonderful the unknown must be .
Sa@@ mu@@ el is 16 . He &apos;s tall . He &apos;s very hand@@ some .
He has the most imp@@ ec@@ c@@ able memory .
He has a sel@@ ective one , though .
He doesn &apos;t remember if he st@@ ole my chocolate bar , but he re@@ members the year of release for every song on my iP@@ od , conversations we had when he was four , wee@@ ing on my arm on the first ever epi@@ so@@ de of T@@ ele@@ tu@@ b@@ bi@@ es , and Lad@@ y G@@ ag@@ a &apos;s birthday .
Don &apos;t they sound incredible ?
But most people don &apos;t agree .
And in fact , because their minds don &apos;t fit into society &apos;s version of normal , they &apos;re often by@@ passed and mi@@ sun@@ der@@ stood .
But what lif@@ ted my heart and streng@@ th@@ ened my soul was that even though this was the case , although they were not seen as ordinary , this could only mean one thing : that they were extraordinary -- auti@@ stic and extraordinary .
Now , for you who may be less familiar with the term &quot; autism , &quot; it &apos;s a complex brain disorder that aff@@ ects social communication , learning and sometimes physical skills .
It mani@@ fe@@ sts in each individual differently , h@@ ence why Re@@ mi is so different from Sam .
And across the world , every 20 minutes , one new person is diagnosed with autism , and although it &apos;s one of the fa@@ st@@ est@@ -@@ growing develop@@ mental dis@@ orders in the world , there is no known cause or cure .
And I cannot remember the first moment I encoun@@ tered autism , but I cannot rec@@ all a day without it .
I was just three years old when my brother came along , and I was so excited that I had a new being in my life .
And after a few months went by , I realized that he was different .
He scre@@ amed a lot .
He didn &apos;t want to play like the other babies did , and in fact , he didn &apos;t seem very interested in me what@@ so@@ ever .
Re@@ mi lived and re@@ ig@@ ned in his own world , with his own rules , and he found pleasure in the sm@@ alle@@ st things , like lin@@ ing up cars around the room and star@@ ing at the wash@@ ing machine and eating anything that came in between .
And as he grew older , he grew more different , and the differences became more obvious .
Yet beyond the tan@@ tru@@ ms and the frustr@@ ation and the ne@@ ver@@ -@@ ending hyper@@ activity was something really unique : a pure and inno@@ cent nature , a boy who saw the world without pre@@ ju@@ di@@ ce , a human who had never lied .
Ex@@ tra@@ ordinary .
Now , I cannot den@@ y that there have been some challenging moments in my family , moments where I &apos;ve wi@@ shed that they were just like me .
But I cast my mind back to the things that they &apos;ve taught me about individu@@ ality and communication and love , and I realize that these are things that I wouldn &apos;t want to change with norm@@ ality .
Nor@@ m@@ ality over@@ looks the beauty that differences give us , and the fact that we are different doesn &apos;t mean that one of us is wrong .
It just means that there &apos;s a different kind of right .
And if I could communicate just one thing to Re@@ mi and to Sam and to you , it would be that you don &apos;t have to be normal .
You can be extraordinary .
Because auti@@ stic or not , the differences that we have -- We &apos;ve got a gift ! Everyone &apos;s got a gift inside of us , and in all honest@@ y , the pur@@ suit of norm@@ ality is the ultimate sacrifi@@ ce of potential .
The chance for great@@ ness , for progress and for change dies the moment we try to be like someone else .
Please -- don &apos;t tell me I &apos;m normal .
Thank you .
You probably all agree with me that this is a very nice road .
It &apos;s made of as@@ ph@@ al@@ t , and as@@ ph@@ al@@ t is a very nice material to drive on , but not always , especially not on these days as today , when it &apos;s ra@@ ining a lot .
Then you can have a lot of sp@@ la@@ sh water in the as@@ ph@@ al@@ t .
And especially if you then ride with your bicycle , and pass these cars , then that &apos;s not very nice .
Also , as@@ ph@@ al@@ t can create a lot of noise .
It &apos;s a no@@ is@@ y material , and if we produce roads like in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands , very close to cities , then we would like a silent road .
The solution for that is to make roads out of por@@ ous as@@ ph@@ al@@ t .
Por@@ ous as@@ ph@@ al@@ t , a material that we use now in most of the high@@ ways in the Ne@@ ther@@ lands , it has po@@ res and water can just rain through it , so all the rain@@ water will flow away to the sides , and you have a road that &apos;s easy to drive on , so no sp@@ la@@ sh water anymore .
Also the noise will disappear in these po@@ res .
Because it &apos;s very hol@@ low , all the noise will disappear , so it &apos;s a very silent road .
It also has disa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ ages , of course , and the disa@@ d@@ v@@ antage of this road is that ra@@ v@@ eling can occur .
What is ra@@ v@@ eling ? You see that in this road that the st@@ ones at the surface come off .
First you get one stone , then several more , and more and more and more and more , and then they -- well , I will not do that .
But they can damage your win@@ d@@ shi@@ eld , so you &apos;re not happy with that .
And finally , this ra@@ v@@ eling can also lead to more and more damage .
Sometimes you can create po@@ th@@ ol@@ es with that .
H@@ a . He &apos;s ready .
Po@@ th@@ ol@@ es , of course , that can become a problem , but we have a solution .
Here you see actually how the damage appears in this material .
It &apos;s a por@@ ous as@@ ph@@ al@@ t , like I said , so you have only a small amount of b@@ in@@ der between the st@@ ones .
Du@@ e to wea@@ ther@@ ing , due to U.@@ V@@ . light , due to ox@@ id@@ ation , this b@@ in@@ der , this bit@@ u@@ men , the glu@@ e between the aggre@@ g@@ ates is going to sh@@ r@@ ink , and if it sh@@ r@@ in@@ ks , it gets micro@@ -@@ cr@@ acks , and it del@@ am@@ in@@ ates from the aggre@@ g@@ ates .
Then if you drive over the road , you take out the aggre@@ g@@ ates -- what we just saw here .
To solve this problem , we thought of self-@@ heal@@ ing materials .
If we can make this material self-@@ heal@@ ing , then probably we have a solution .
So what we can do is use steel wo@@ ol just to clean p@@ ans , and the steel wo@@ ol we can cut in very small pieces , and these very small pieces we can mix to the bit@@ u@@ men .
So then you have as@@ ph@@ al@@ t with very small pieces of steel wo@@ ol in it .
Then you need a machine , like you see here , that you can use for cooking -- an in@@ duction machine .
In@@ duction can heat , especially steel ; it &apos;s very good at that .
Then what you do is you heat up the steel , you mel@@ t the bit@@ u@@ men , and the bit@@ u@@ men will flow into these micro@@ -@@ cr@@ acks , and the st@@ ones are again fixed to the surface .
Today I use a micro@@ wave because I cannot take the big in@@ duction machine here on@@ stage .
So a micro@@ wave is a similar system .
So I put the spec@@ im@@ en in , which I &apos;m now going to take out to see what happened .
So this is the spec@@ im@@ en coming out now .
So I said we have such an industrial machine in the lab to heat up the spec@@ im@@ ens .
We tested a lot of spec@@ im@@ ens there , and then the government , they actually saw our results , and they thought , &quot; Well , that &apos;s very interesting . We have to try that . &quot;
So they don@@ ated to us a piece of high@@ way , 400 meters of the A@@ 58 , where we had to make a test track to test this material .
So that &apos;s what we did here . You see where we were making the test road , and then of course this road will last several years without any damage . That &apos;s what we know from practice .
So we took a lot of samples from this road and we tested them in the lab .
So we did aging on the samples , did a lot of lo@@ ading on it , heal@@ ed them with our in@@ duction machine , and heal@@ ed them and tested them again .
Se@@ ver@@ al times we can repe@@ at that .
So actually , the conclusion from this research is that if we go on the road every four years with our heal@@ ing machine -- this is the big version we have made to go on the real road -- if we go on the road every four years we can double the surface life of this road , which of course sa@@ ves a lot of money .
Well , to conclu@@ de , I can say that we made a material using steel fi@@ b@@ ers , the addition of steel fi@@ b@@ ers , using in@@ duction energy to really increase the surface life of the road , double the surface life you can even do , so it will really save a lot of money with very simple tr@@ icks .
And now you &apos;re of course curious if it also worked .
So we still have the spec@@ im@@ en here . It &apos;s quite warm .
Actually , it still has to cool down first before I can show you that the heal@@ ing works .
But I will do a trial .
Let &apos;s see . Yeah , it worked .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here today to talk about a distur@@ bing question , which has an equally distur@@ bing answer .
My topic is the secre@@ ts of dom@@ es@@ tic violence , and the question I &apos;m going to tack@@ le is the one question everyone always asks : Why does she stay ?
Why would anyone stay with a man who be@@ ats her ?
I &apos;m not a psychi@@ a@@ tri@@ st , a social worker or an expert in dom@@ es@@ tic violence .
I &apos;m just one woman with a story to tell .
I was 22 . I had just gradu@@ ated from Harvard Col@@ lege .
I had moved to New York City for my first job as a writer and edit@@ or at S@@ even@@ teen magazine .
I had my first apartment , my first little green American Ex@@ press card , and I had a very big secret .
My secret was that I had this gun lo@@ aded with hol@@ low-@@ point bul@@ lets pointed at my head by the man who I thought was my sou@@ l@@ mate , many , many times .
The man who I loved more than anybody on Earth held a gun to my head and threat@@ ened to kill me more times than I can even remember .
I &apos;m here to tell you the story of crazy love , a psycho@@ logical tra@@ p dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as love , one that millions of women and even a few men fall into every year .
It may even be your story .
I don &apos;t look like a typical dom@@ es@@ tic violence survi@@ vor .
I have a B@@ .@@ A. in English from Harvard Col@@ lege , an M@@ BA in marketing from Wh@@ ar@@ ton B@@ us@@ iness School .
I &apos;ve spent most of my career working for For@@ tune 500 companies including John@@ son &amp; amp ; John@@ son , Le@@ o Bur@@ net@@ t and The Washington P@@ ost .
I &apos;ve been married for almost 20 years to my second husband and we have three kids together .
My dog is a black lab , and I drive a Hon@@ da O@@ dy@@ s@@ sey mini@@ van .
So my first message for you is that dom@@ es@@ tic violence happens to everyone -- all r@@ aces , all religions , all income and education levels .
It &apos;s everywhere .
And my second message is that everyone thinks dom@@ es@@ tic violence happens to women , that it &apos;s a women &apos;s issue .
Not exactly .
Over 85 percent of ab@@ users are men , and dom@@ es@@ tic ab@@ use happens only in in@@ timate , inter@@ dependent , long-term relationships , in other words , in families , the last place we would want or expect to find violence , which is one reason dom@@ es@@ tic ab@@ use is so confu@@ sing .
I would have told you myself that I was the last person on Earth who would stay with a man who be@@ ats me , but in fact I was a very typical vic@@ tim because of my age .
I was 22 , and in the United States , women ages 16 to 24 are three times as likely to be dom@@ es@@ tic violence victims as women of other ages , and over 500 women and girls this age are killed every year by abu@@ sive partners , bo@@ y@@ friends , and hus@@ b@@ ands in the United States .
I was also a very typical vic@@ tim because I knew nothing about dom@@ es@@ tic violence , its war@@ ning signs or its patterns .
I met Con@@ or on a cold , rain@@ y January night .
He sat next to me on the New York City sub@@ way , and he started ch@@ at@@ ting me up .
He told me two things .
One was that he , too , had just gradu@@ ated from an I@@ vy Lea@@ gue school , and that he worked at a very imp@@ res@@ sive Wall Street bank .
But what made the biggest impre@@ ssion on me that first meeting was that he was smart and funny and he looked like a farm boy .
He had these big chee@@ ks , these big apple chee@@ ks and this whe@@ at@@ -@@ bl@@ ond hair , and he seemed so sweet .
One of the smar@@ test things Con@@ or did , from the very beginning , was to create the illusion that I was the dominant partner in the relationship .
He did this especially at the beginning by i@@ do@@ li@@ zing me .
We started da@@ ting , and he loved everything about me , that I was smart , that I &apos;d gone to Harvard , that I was passionate about helping teen@@ age girls , and my job .
He wanted to know everything about my family and my childhood and my ho@@ pes and dreams .
Con@@ or believed in me , as a writer and a woman , in a way that no one else ever had .
And he also created a magi@@ cal atmosphere of trust between us by conf@@ ess@@ ing his secret , which was that , as a very young boy starting at age four , he had been sa@@ va@@ gely and repe@@ ate@@ dly physically ab@@ used by his st@@ ep@@ father , and the ab@@ use had gotten so bad that he had had to drop out of school in ei@@ gh@@ th grade , even though he was very smart , and he &apos;d spent almost 20 years re@@ building his life .
Which is why that I@@ vy Lea@@ gue degree and the Wall Street job and his bright sh@@ in@@ y future meant so much to him .
If you had told me that this smart , funny , sensitive man who ado@@ red me would one day dic@@ tate whether or not I wor@@ e ma@@ ke@@ up , how short my ski@@ r@@ ts were , where I lived , what jobs I took , who my friends were and where I spent Christmas , I would have laugh@@ ed at you , because there was not a h@@ int of violence or control or anger in Con@@ or at the beginning .
I didn &apos;t know that the first stage in any dom@@ es@@ tic violence relationship is to se@@ duce and char@@ m the vic@@ tim .
I also didn &apos;t know that the second step is to is@@ ol@@ ate the vic@@ tim .
Now , Con@@ or did not come home one day and announ@@ ce , &quot; You know , h@@ ey , all this R@@ ome@@ o and Juli@@ et stuff has been great , but I need to move into the next phase where I is@@ ol@@ ate you and I ab@@ use you &quot; — — &quot; so I need to get you out of this apartment where the neighbors can hear you scre@@ am and out of this city where you have friends and family and co@@ workers who can see the bru@@ ises . &quot;
Instead , Con@@ or came home one Fri@@ day evening and he told me that he had qu@@ it his job that day , his dream job , and he said that he had qu@@ it his job because of me , because I had made him feel so safe and loved that he didn &apos;t need to prove himself on Wall Street anymore , and he just wanted to get out of the city and away from his abu@@ sive , dy@@ s@@ functional family , and move to a tiny town in New England where he could start his life over with me by his side .
Now , the last thing I wanted to do was leave New York , and my dream job , but I thought you made sacrifi@@ ces for your sou@@ l@@ mate , so I agreed , and I qu@@ it my job , and Con@@ or and I left Manhattan together .
I had no idea I was falling into crazy love , that I was walking head@@ first into a carefully la@@ id physical , financial and psycho@@ logical tra@@ p .
The next step in the dom@@ es@@ tic violence pattern is to introduce the threat of violence and see how she re@@ acts .
And here &apos;s where those gun@@ s come in .
As soon as we moved to New England -- you know , that place where Con@@ nor was supposed to feel so safe -- he bought three gun@@ s .
He kept one in the g@@ love com@@ partment of our car .
He kept one under the pil@@ lo@@ ws on our bed , and the third one he kept in his pocket at all times .
And he said that he needed those gun@@ s because of the trau@@ ma he &apos;d experienced as a young boy .
He needed them to feel protected .
But those gun@@ s were really a message for me , and even though he hadn &apos;t raised a hand to me , my life was already in gra@@ ve danger every minute of every day .
Con@@ or first physically att@@ acked me five days before our we@@ dding .
It was 7 a@@ .m. I still had on my ni@@ ght@@ go@@ wn .
I was working on my computer trying to finish a fre@@ el@@ ance writing as@@ sign@@ ment , and I got frustr@@ ated , and Con@@ or used my anger as an ex@@ cu@@ se to put both of his hands around my nec@@ k and to squ@@ ee@@ ze so ti@@ ghtly that I could not breathe or scre@@ am , and he used the cho@@ ke@@ hold to hit my head repe@@ ate@@ dly against the wall .
Five days later , the ten bru@@ ises on my nec@@ k had just f@@ aded , and I put on my mother &apos;s we@@ dding dre@@ ss , and I married him .
D@@ esp@@ ite what had happened , I was sure we were going to live happ@@ ily ever after , because I loved him , and he loved me so much .
And he was very , very sorry .
He had just been really stress@@ ed out by the we@@ dding and by becoming a family with me .
It was an is@@ ol@@ ated inci@@ dent , and he was never going to hurt me again .
It happened twice more on the hon@@ ey@@ moon .
The first time , I was driving to find a secret beach and I got lost , and he pun@@ ched me in the side of my head so hard that the other side of my head repe@@ ate@@ dly hit the driver &apos;s side window .
And then a few days later , driving home from our hon@@ ey@@ moon , he got frustr@@ ated by traffic , and he thre@@ w a cold Big Ma@@ c in my face .
Con@@ or pro@@ cee@@ ded to beat me once or twice a week for the next two and a half years of our marriage .
I was mista@@ ken in thinking that I was unique and alone in this situation .
One in three American women experiences dom@@ es@@ tic violence or st@@ al@@ king at some point in her life , and the C@@ D@@ C repor@@ ts that 15 million children are ab@@ used every year , 15 million .
So actually , I was in very good company .
B@@ ack to my question : Why did I stay ?
The answer is easy .
I didn &apos;t know he was ab@@ using me .
Even though he held those lo@@ aded gun@@ s to my head , pu@@ shed me down sta@@ irs , threat@@ ened to kill our dog , pulled the key out of the car ig@@ ni@@ tion as I dro@@ ve down the high@@ way , p@@ ou@@ red coffee gr@@ in@@ ds on my head as I dre@@ ssed for a job interview , I never once thought of myself as a bat@@ tered wife .
Instead , I was a very strong woman in love with a deeply trou@@ b@@ led man , and I was the only person on Earth who could help Con@@ or face his dem@@ ons .
The other question everybody asks is , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
Why didn &apos;t I walk out ? I could have left any time .
To me , this is the sa@@ d@@ dest and most painful question that people ask , because we victims know something you usually don &apos;t : It &apos;s incredibly dangerous to leave an ab@@ user .
Because the final step in the dom@@ es@@ tic violence pattern is kill her .
Over 70 percent of dom@@ es@@ tic violence mur@@ ders happen after the vic@@ tim has ended the relationship , after she &apos;s gotten out , because then the ab@@ user has nothing left to lose .
Other outcomes include long-term st@@ al@@ king , even after the ab@@ user re@@ mar@@ ries ; den@@ ial of financial resources ; and manipu@@ lation of the family cour@@ t system to terri@@ fy the vic@@ tim and her children , who are regu@@ larly forced by family cour@@ t jud@@ ges to spend un@@ super@@ vi@@ sed time with the man who beat their mother .
And still we ask , why doesn &apos;t she just leave ?
I was able to leave , because of one final , sa@@ di@@ stic be@@ ating that broke through my den@@ ial .
I realized that the man who I loved so much was going to kill me if I let him .
So I broke the silence .
I told everyone : the police , my neighbors , my friends and family , total strangers , and I &apos;m here today because you all helped me .
We tend to stere@@ oty@@ pe victims as g@@ ris@@ ly head@@ lines , self-@@ de@@ struc@@ tive women , da@@ mag@@ ed goods .
The question , &quot; Why does she stay ? &quot;
is code for some people for , &quot; It &apos;s her f@@ au@@ lt for sta@@ ying , &quot; as if victims inten@@ tionally choose to fall in love with men in@@ tent upon destro@@ ying us .
But since publi@@ shing &quot; Cra@@ zy Lo@@ ve , &quot; I have heard hundreds of stories from men and women who also got out , who learned an in@@ valuable life lesson from what happened , and who re@@ built lives -- jo@@ y@@ ous , happy lives -- as employees , wi@@ ves and mothers , lives completely free of violence , like me .
Because it turns out that I &apos;m actually a very typical dom@@ es@@ tic violence vic@@ tim and a typical dom@@ es@@ tic violence survi@@ vor .
I re@@ married a kind and gen@@ tle man , and we have those three kids .
I have that black lab , and I have that mini@@ van .
What I will never have again , ever , is a lo@@ aded gun held to my head by someone who says that he lo@@ ves me .
Right now , maybe you &apos;re thinking , &quot; Wow , this is fascinating , &quot; or , &quot; Wow , how stupid was she , &quot; but this whole time , I &apos;ve actually been talking about you .
I promise you there are several people listening to me right now who are currently being ab@@ used or who were ab@@ used as children or who are ab@@ users themselves .
A@@ bu@@ se could be aff@@ ecting your daughter , your sister , your best friend right now .
I was able to end my own crazy love story by breaking the silence .
I &apos;m still breaking the silence today .
It &apos;s my way of helping other victims , and it &apos;s my final re@@ quest of you .
Talk about what you heard here .
A@@ bu@@ se thri@@ ves only in silence .
You have the power to end dom@@ es@@ tic violence simply by sh@@ ining a sp@@ ot@@ light on it .
We victims need everyone .
We need every one of you to understand the secre@@ ts of dom@@ es@@ tic violence .
S@@ how ab@@ use the light of day by talking about it with your children , your co@@ workers , your friends and family .
Rec@@ ast survi@@ v@@ ors as wonderful , lo@@ vable people with full fu@@ tures .
Rec@@ o@@ gni@@ ze the early signs of violence and con@@ scienti@@ ously interven@@ e , de@@ es@@ cal@@ ate it , show victims a safe way out .
To@@ gether we can make our be@@ ds , our dinner tables and our families the safe and peace@@ ful o@@ ases they should be .
Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about a very special group of animals .
There are 10,000 species of birds in the world .
V@@ ul@@ tures are amongst the most threat@@ ened group of birds .
When you see a vul@@ ture like this , the first thing that comes to your mind is , these are dis@@ gu@@ sting , ug@@ ly , gre@@ e@@ dy creatures that are just after your fle@@ sh , associated with politicians .
I want to change that perception . I want to change those feelings you have for these birds , because they need our symp@@ athy . They really do .
And I &apos;ll tell you why .
First of all , why do they have such a bad press ?
When Charles Darwin went across the Atlan@@ tic in 18@@ 32 on the B@@ ea@@ g@@ le , he saw the tur@@ key vul@@ ture , and he said , &quot; These are dis@@ gu@@ sting birds with bal@@ d scar@@ let heads that are formed to re@@ vel in pu@@ tri@@ d@@ ity . &quot;
You could not get a worse insul@@ t , and that from Charles Darwin .
You know , he changed his mind when he came back , and I &apos;ll tell you why .
They &apos;ve also be associated with Dis@@ ney — — person@@ i@@ fied as go@@ of@@ y , du@@ mb , stupid characters .
More recently , if you &apos;ve been following the Ken@@ yan press — — these are the attribu@@ tes that they associated the Ken@@ yan M@@ P@@ s with . But I want to challenge that .
I want to challenge that . Do you know why ?
Because M@@ P@@ s do not keep the environment clean .
M@@ P@@ s do not help to prevent the spread of diseases .
They are har@@ dly mon@@ o@@ gam@@ ous .
They are far from being extinct .
And , my favorite is , vul@@ tures are better looking .
So there &apos;s two types of vul@@ tures in this planet .
There are the New World vul@@ tures that are mainly found in the Americ@@ as , like the con@@ d@@ ors and the car@@ ac@@ ar@@ as , and then the O@@ ld World vul@@ tures , where we have 16 species . From these 16 , 11 of them are facing a high risk of extin@@ ction .
So why are vul@@ tures important ? First of all , they provide vit@@ al ec@@ ological services . They clean up .
They &apos;re our natural gar@@ b@@ age coll@@ ec@@ tors .
They clean up car@@ cas@@ ses right to the bone .
They help to kill all the bacteria . They help absor@@ b an@@ th@@ ra@@ x that would otherwise spread and cause huge li@@ ve@@ stock los@@ ses and diseases in other animals .
Rec@@ ent studies have shown that in areas where there are no vul@@ tures , car@@ cas@@ ses take up to three to four times to dec@@ om@@ pose , and this has huge rami@@ fi@@ cations for the spread of diseases .
V@@ ul@@ tures also have tremendous historical signific@@ ance .
They have been associated in ancient Egy@@ p@@ tian culture .
Ne@@ kh@@ bet was the symbol of the prot@@ ector and the mo@@ ther@@ hood , and together with the co@@ b@@ ra , symbo@@ li@@ zed the un@@ ity between U@@ pper and Lo@@ wer Egypt .
In H@@ in@@ du my@@ tho@@ logy , J@@ at@@ a@@ y@@ u was the vul@@ ture go@@ d , and he ris@@ ked his life in order to save the go@@ d@@ de@@ ss S@@ it@@ a from the 10@@ -@@ hea@@ ded dem@@ on Ra@@ v@@ ana .
In Ti@@ be@@ tan culture , they are performing very important sky bu@@ ri@@ als . In places like Ti@@ bet , there are no places to bu@@ ry the dead , or wood to cre@@ mate them , so these vul@@ tures provide a natural disp@@ os@@ al system .
So what is the problem with vul@@ tures ?
We have eight species of vul@@ tures that occur in Kenya , of which six are highly threat@@ ened with extin@@ ction .
The reason is that they &apos;re getting po@@ is@@ oned , and the reason that they &apos;re getting po@@ is@@ oned is because there &apos;s human@@ -@@ wil@@ d@@ life conflicts . The pa@@ stor@@ al communities are using this po@@ ison to target pred@@ ators , and in return , the vul@@ tures are falling vic@@ tim to this .
In South Asia , in countries like India and Pakistan , four species of vul@@ tures are li@@ sted as cri@@ tically en@@ dang@@ ered , which means they have less than 10 or 15 years to go extinct , and the reason is because they are falling pre@@ y by consu@@ ming li@@ ve@@ stock that has been treated with a pain@@ killing drug like D@@ ic@@ lo@@ f@@ en@@ ac .
This drug has now been ban@@ ned for ve@@ ter@@ inary use in India , and they have taken a stand .
Because there are no vul@@ tures , there &apos;s been a spread in the numbers of fer@@ al dogs at car@@ cas@@ s du@@ mp sites , and when you have fer@@ al dogs , you have a huge time bomb of r@@ ab@@ ies . The number of cases of r@@ ab@@ ies has increased tremend@@ ously in India .
Kenya is going to have one of the largest wind far@@ ms in Africa : 3@@ 5@@ 3 wind tur@@ b@@ ines are going to be up at La@@ ke Tur@@ k@@ ana .
I am not against wind energy , but we need to work with the governments , because wind tur@@ b@@ ines do this to birds . They sli@@ ce them in half .
They are bir@@ d-@@ bl@@ ending machines .
In West Africa , there &apos;s a horri@@ fic trade of dead vul@@ tures to serve the wit@@ ch@@ craft and the fe@@ tish market .
So what &apos;s being done ? Well , we &apos;re conduc@@ ting research on these birds . We &apos;re putting trans@@ mit@@ ters on them .
We &apos;re trying to determine their basic ec@@ ology , and see where they go .
We can see that they travel different countries , so if you focus on a problem lo@@ cally , it &apos;s not going to help you .
We need to work with governments in regi@@ on@@ al levels .
We &apos;re working with local communities .
We &apos;re talking to them about appreci@@ ating vul@@ tures , about the need from within to appreciate these wonderful creatures and the services that they provide .
How can you help ? You can become active , make noise . You can write a letter to your government and tell them that we need to focus on these very mi@@ sun@@ der@@ stood creatures . V@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ er your time to spread the word . S@@ pre@@ ad the word .
When you walk out of this room , you will be in@@ formed about vul@@ tures , but speak to your families , to your children , to your neighbors about vul@@ tures .
They are very gr@@ ace@@ ful . Charles Darwin said he changed his mind because he watched them fly effor@@ t@@ lessly without energy in the ski@@ es .
Kenya , this world , will be much po@@ ore@@ r without these wonderful species .
Thank you very much .
When I was 11 , I remember wa@@ king up one morning to the sound of joy in my house .
My father was listening to B@@ BC Ne@@ ws on his small , gray radio .
There was a big smile on his face which was unusual then , because the news mostly de@@ pressed him .
&quot; The Taliban are gone ! &quot; my father sh@@ ou@@ ted .
I didn &apos;t know what it meant , but I could see that my father was very , very happy .
&quot; You can go to a real school now , &quot; he said .
A morning that I will never forget .
A real school .
You see , I was six when the Taliban took over Afghanistan and made it illegal for girls to go to school .
So for the next five years , I dre@@ ssed as a boy to es@@ c@@ ort my older sister , who was no longer allowed to be outside alone , to a secret school .
It was the only way we both could be educ@@ ated .
Each day , we took a different rou@@ te so that no one would susp@@ ect where we were going .
We would cover our books in gro@@ cer@@ y b@@ ags so it would seem we were just out shopping .
The school was in a house , more than 100 of us p@@ acked in one small living room .
It was co@@ zy in winter but extremely hot in summer .
We all knew we were ris@@ king our lives -- the teacher , the students and our parents .
From time to time , the school would suddenly be can@@ cel@@ ed for a week because Taliban were su@@ spi@@ cious .
We always wondered what they knew about us .
W@@ ere we being followed ?
Do they know where we live ?
We were scared , but still , school was where we wanted to be .
I was very lucky to grow up in a family where education was pri@@ zed and dau@@ ghters were tr@@ ea@@ su@@ red .
My grandfather was an extraordinary man for his time .
A total ma@@ ver@@ ick from a remote pro@@ vin@@ ce of Afghanistan , he insi@@ sted that his daughter , my mom , go to school , and for that he was di@@ so@@ w@@ ned by his father .
But my educ@@ ated mother became a teacher .
There she is .
She reti@@ red two years ago , only to turn our house into a school for girls and women in our neighborhood .
And my father -- that &apos;s him -- he was the first ever in his family to receive an education .
There was no question that his children would receive an education , including his dau@@ ghters , despite the Taliban , despite the risks .
To him , there was greater risk in not edu@@ cating his children .
Dur@@ ing Taliban years , I remember there were times I would get so frustr@@ ated by our life and always being scared and not seeing a future .
I would want to qu@@ it , but my father , he would say , &quot; Li@@ sten , my daughter , you can lose everything you own in your life .
Your money can be st@@ ol@@ en . You can be forced to leave your home during a war .
But the one thing that will always remain with you is what is here , and if we have to sell our blood to pay your school fe@@ es , we will .
So do you still not want to continue ? &quot;
Today I am 22 .
I was raised in a country that has been destroyed by decades of war .
Fe@@ wer than six percent of women my age have made it beyond high school , and had my family not been so commit@@ ted to my education , I would be one of them .
Instead , I stand here a proud graduate of Mi@@ dd@@ le@@ bu@@ ry Col@@ lege .
When I returned to Afghanistan , my grandfather , the one ex@@ iled from his home for dar@@ ing to educ@@ ate his dau@@ ghters , was among the first to cong@@ r@@ at@@ ul@@ ate me .
He not only bra@@ gs about my college degree , but also that I was the first woman , and that I am the first woman to drive him through the streets of K@@ abu@@ l .
My family believ@@ es in me .
I dream big , but my family dreams even bigger for me .
That &apos;s why I am a global am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or for 10@@ x@@ 10 , a global campaign to educ@@ ate women .
That &apos;s why I co@@ foun@@ ded SO@@ L@@ A , the first and perhaps only bo@@ ar@@ ding school for girls in Afghanistan , a country where it &apos;s still ri@@ sky for girls to go to school .
The exciting thing is that I see students at my school with ambi@@ tion gr@@ ab@@ bing at opportunity .
And I see their parents and their fathers who , like my own , ad@@ voc@@ ate for them , despite and even in the face of dau@@ n@@ ting op@@ position .
Like Ah@@ med . That &apos;s not his real name , and I cannot show you his face , but Ah@@ med is the father of one of my students .
L@@ ess than a month ago , he and his daughter were on their way from SO@@ L@@ A to their village , and they literally missed being killed by a ro@@ ad@@ side bomb by minutes .
As he arrived home , the phone r@@ ang , a voice war@@ ning him that if he sent his daughter back to school , they would try again .
&quot; K@@ ill me now , if you wish , &quot; he said , &quot; but I will not ru@@ in my daughter &apos;s future because of your old and back@@ ward ideas . &quot;
What I &apos;ve come to realize about Afghanistan , and this is something that is often dis@@ missed in the West , that behind most of us who succeed is a father who recogni@@ zes the value in his daughter and who sees that her success is his success .
It &apos;s not to say that our mothers aren &apos;t key in our success .
In fact , they &apos;re often the initi@@ al and convin@@ cing negoti@@ ators of a bright future for their dau@@ ghters , but in the context of a society like in Afghanistan , we must have the support of men .
Un@@ der the Taliban , girls who went to school nu@@ mb@@ ered in the hundreds -- remember , it was illegal .
But today , more than three million girls are in school in Afghanistan .
Afghanistan looks so different from here in America .
I find that Americans see the fra@@ gi@@ lity in changes .
I fear that these changes will not last much beyond the U.S. tro@@ ops &apos; with@@ dra@@ w@@ al .
But when I am back in Afghanistan , when I see the students in my school and their parents who ad@@ voc@@ ate for them , who encourage them , I see a prom@@ ising future and la@@ sting change .
To me , Afghanistan is a country of hope and boun@@ dless possibilities , and every single day the girls of SO@@ L@@ A remind me of that .
Like me , they are dre@@ aming big .
Thank you .
Hi . This is my mobile phone .
A mobile phone can change your life , and a mobile phone gives you individual freedom .
With a mobile phone , you can shoot a crime against humanity in Syria .
With a mobile phone , you can tw@@ eet a message and start a prot@@ est in Egypt .
And with a mobile phone , you can record a song , load it up to S@@ oun@@ d@@ C@@ loud and become famous .
All this is possible with your mobile phone .
I &apos;m a child of 1984 , and I live in the city of Ber@@ lin .
Let &apos;s go back to that time , to this city .
Here you can see how hundreds of thousands of people stood up and prot@@ ested for change .
This is au@@ tu@@ m@@ n 198@@ 9 , and imagine that all those people standing up and prot@@ esting for change had a mobile phone in their pocket .
Who in the room has a mobile phone with you ?
Ho@@ ld it up .
Ho@@ ld your phones up , hold your phones up !
Ho@@ ld it up . An An@@ dro@@ id , a Bl@@ ack@@ berry , w@@ ow .
That &apos;s a lot . Al@@ most everybody today has a mobile phone .
But today I will talk about me and my mobile phone , and how it changed my life .
And I will talk about this .
These are 3@@ 5@@ ,@@ 8@@ 30 lines of information .
Ra@@ w data .
And why are these in@@ for@@ ma@@ tions there ?
Because in the summer of 2006 , the E.@@ U@@ . Com@@ mission t@@ abled a direc@@ tive .
This direc@@ tive &#91; is &#93; called Da@@ ta Re@@ ten@@ tion Di@@ rec@@ tive .
This direc@@ tive says that each phone company in Europe , each Internet service company all over Europe , has to store a wide range of information about the users .
Who calls whom ? Who sen@@ ds whom an email ?
Who sen@@ ds whom a text message ?
And if you use your mobile phone , where you are .
All this information is sto@@ red for at least six months , up to two years by your phone company or your Internet service provi@@ der .
And all over Europe , people stood up and said , &quot; We don &apos;t want this . &quot;
They said , we don &apos;t want this data re@@ ten@@ tion .
We want self-@@ determin@@ ation in the digital age , and we don &apos;t want that phone companies and Internet companies have to store all this information about us .
They were law@@ yers , journ@@ alists , pri@@ ests , they all said : &quot; We don &apos;t want this . &quot;
And here you can see , like 10 thousands of people went out on the streets of Ber@@ lin and said , &quot; Free@@ dom , not fear . &quot;
And some even said , this would be St@@ as@@ i 2.@@ 0 .
St@@ as@@ i was the secret police in East Germany .
And I also ask myself , does it really work ?
Can they really store all this information about us ?
Every time I use my mobile phone ?
So I asked my phone company , De@@ ut@@ s@@ che T@@ ele@@ k@@ om , which was at that time the largest phone company in Germany , and I asked them , please , send me all the information you have sto@@ red about me .
And I asked them once , and I asked them again , and I got no real answer . It was only bla@@ h bla@@ h answers .
But then I said , I want to have this information , because this is my life you are prot@@ o@@ col@@ ing .
So I decided to start a law@@ suit against them , because I wanted to have this information .
But De@@ ut@@ s@@ che T@@ ele@@ k@@ om said , no , we will not give you this information .
So at the end , I had a set@@ tle@@ ment with them .
I &apos;ll put down the law@@ suit and they will send me all the information I ask for .
Because in the mean time , the German Con@@ stitu@@ tional C@@ our@@ t ru@@ led that the imple@@ men@@ tation of this E.@@ U@@ . direc@@ tive into German law was un@@ constitu@@ tional .
So I got this ug@@ ly bro@@ wn en@@ velo@@ pe with a C@@ .D. inside .
And on the C@@ .D. , this was on .
Th@@ ir@@ ty-@@ five thousand eight hundred thir@@ ty lines of information .
At first I saw it , and I said , okay , it &apos;s a huge file . Okay .
But then after a while I realized , this is my life .
This is six months of my life , into this file .
So I was a little bit s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical , what should I do with it ?
Because you can see where I am , where I sleep at night , what I am doing .
But then I said , I want to go out with this information .
I want to make them public .
Because I want to show the people what does data re@@ ten@@ tion mean .
So together with Z@@ e@@ it On@@ line and O@@ pen Da@@ ta City , I did this .
This is a visu@@ alization of six months of my life .
You can zoom in and zoom out , you can wind back and fast forward .
You can see every step I take .
And you can even see how I go from Frank@@ fur@@ t by train to Co@@ lo@@ g@@ ne , and how often I call in between .
All this is possible with this information .
That &apos;s a little bit scary .
But it is not only about me .
It &apos;s about all of us .
First , it &apos;s only like , I call my wife and she calls me , and we talk to each other a couple of times .
And then there are some friends calling me , and they call each other .
And after a while you are calling you , and you are calling you , and you have this great communication network .
But you can see how your people are communi@@ cating with each other , what times they call each other , when they go to bed .
You can see all of this .
You can see the hu@@ bs , like who are the leaders in the group .
If you have access to this information , you can see what your society is doing .
If you have access to this information , you can control your society .
This is a blu@@ e@@ print for countries like China and Iran .
This is a blu@@ e@@ print how to survey your society , because you know who talks to whom , who sen@@ ds whom an email , all this is possible if you have access to this information .
And this information is sto@@ red for at least six months in Europe , up to two years .
Like I said at the beginning , imagine that all those people on the streets of Ber@@ lin in au@@ tu@@ m@@ n of 198@@ 9 had a mobile phone in their pocket .
And the St@@ as@@ i would have known who took part at this prot@@ est , and if the St@@ as@@ i would have known who are the leaders behind it , this may never have happened .
The fall of the Ber@@ lin Wall would maybe not &#91; have been &#93; there .
And in the after@@ math , also not the fall of the I@@ ron C@@ ur@@ tain .
Because today , state agencies and companies want to store as much information as they can get about us , online and off@@ line .
They want to have the possibility to track our lives , and they want to store them for all time .
But self-@@ determin@@ ation and living in the digital age is no contra@@ dic@@ tion .
But you have to fight for your self-@@ determin@@ ation today .
You have to fight for it every day .
So , when you go home , tell your friends that privacy is a value of the 21st century , and it &apos;s not out@@ dated .
When you go home , tell your represen@@ tative only because companies and state agencies have the possibility to store certain information , they don &apos;t have to do it .
And if you don &apos;t believe me , ask your phone company what information they store about you .
So , in the future , every time you use your mobile phone , let it be a remin@@ der to you that you have to fight for self-@@ determin@@ ation in the digital age .
Thank you .
Phot@@ ograp@@ hy has been my passion ever since I was old enough to pick up a camera , but today I want to share with you the 15 most tr@@ ea@@ su@@ red photos of mine , and I didn &apos;t take any of them .
There were no art direc@@ tors , no st@@ y@@ li@@ sts , no chance for re@@ sho@@ ots , not even any reg@@ ard for lighting .
In fact , most of them were taken by random tou@@ ri@@ sts .
My story begins when I was in New York City for a speaking engagement , and my wife took this picture of me holding my daughter on her first birthday . We &apos;re on the corner of 5@@ 7@@ th and 5@@ th .
We happened to be back in New York exactly a year later , so we decided to take the same picture .
Well you can see where this is going .
A@@ p@@ pro@@ a@@ ching my daughter &apos;s third birthday , my wife said , &quot; Hey , why don &apos;t you take S@@ ab@@ ina back to New York and make it a fa@@ ther@@ -@@ daughter trip , and continue the rit@@ ual ? &quot;
This is when we started asking pas@@ sing tou@@ ri@@ sts to take the picture .
You know , it &apos;s remarkable how universal the gestu@@ re is of h@@ anding your camera to a total str@@ anger .
No one &apos;s ever refu@@ sed , and lu@@ cki@@ ly no one &apos;s ever run off with our camera .
B@@ ack then , we had no idea how much this trip would change our lives .
It &apos;s really become sac@@ red to us .
This one was taken just weeks after 9 / 11 , and I found myself trying to explain what had happened that day in ways a fi@@ ve@@ -year-old could understand .
So these photos are far more than pro@@ xies for a single moment , or even a specific trip .
They &apos;re also ways for us to free@@ ze time for one week in Oc@@ to@@ ber and refl@@ ect on our times and how we change from year to year , and not just physically , but in every way .
Because while we take the same photo , our perspec@@ tives change , and she rea@@ ches new mi@@ le@@ st@@ ones , and I get to see life through her eyes , and how she inter@@ acts with and sees everything .
This very focused time we get to spend together is something we ch@@ er@@ ish and anticip@@ ate the entire year .
Rec@@ ently , on one trip , we were walking , and she stop@@ s dead in her trac@@ ks , and she points to a red aw@@ ning of the dol@@ l store that she loved when she was little on our earlier tri@@ ps .
And she describes to me the feeling she felt as a fi@@ ve@@ -year-old standing in that exact spot .
She said she re@@ members her heart bur@@ sting out of her chest when she saw that place for the very first time nine years earlier .
And now what she &apos;s looking at in New York are colle@@ ges , because she &apos;s determin@@ ed to go to school in New York .
And it hit me : One of the most important things we all make are memories .
So I want to share the idea of taking an active role in consci@@ ously creating memories .
I don &apos;t know about you , but a@@ side from these 15 sh@@ ots , I &apos;m not in many of the family photos .
I &apos;m always the one taking the picture .
So I want to encourage everyone today to get in the shot , and don &apos;t h@@ es@@ it@@ ate to go up to someone and ask , &quot; Will you take our picture ? &quot;
Thank you .
I have never , ever for@@ gotten the words of my grandmother who died in her exi@@ le : &quot; S@@ on , resi@@ st G@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i . F@@ ight him .
But don &apos;t you ever turn into a G@@ ad@@ da@@ fi@@ -like rev@@ olutionary . &quot;
Al@@ most two years have passed since the Li@@ by@@ an Revolution broke out , inspired by the waves of mass mobi@@ li@@ zation in both the T@@ uni@@ sian and the Egy@@ p@@ tian rev@@ olu@@ tions .
I joined forces with many other Li@@ by@@ ans inside and outside Lib@@ ya to call for a day of ra@@ ge and to initi@@ ate a revolution against the ty@@ ran@@ nical regi@@ me of G@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i .
And there it was , a great revolution .
You@@ ng Li@@ by@@ an women and men were at the fore@@ front calling for the fall of the regi@@ me , raising slo@@ g@@ ans of freedom , dig@@ nity , social justice .
They have shown an ex@@ emp@@ lary bra@@ very in con@@ fron@@ ting the bru@@ tal dic@@ tat@@ or@@ ship of G@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i .
They have shown a great sense of soli@@ dar@@ ity from the far east to the far west to the south .
E@@ ven@@ tually , after a period of six months of bru@@ tal war and a to@@ ll rate of almost 50,000 dead , we managed to liber@@ ate our country and to to@@ pp@@ le the ty@@ r@@ ant .
However , G@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i left behind a heavy bur@@ den , a leg@@ acy of ty@@ ran@@ ny , corruption and seeds of di@@ ver@@ sions .
For four decades G@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i &apos;s ty@@ ran@@ nical regi@@ me destroyed the infrastructure as well as the culture and the moral fabric of Li@@ by@@ an society .
A@@ ware of the deva@@ station and the challenges , I was ke@@ en among many other women to re@@ build the Li@@ by@@ an civil society , calling for an inclu@@ sive and just transition to democracy and national recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
Al@@ most 200 organizations were estab@@ lished in B@@ eng@@ ha@@ z@@ i during and immediately after the fall of G@@ ad@@ da@@ f@@ i -- almost 300 in Tri@@ pol@@ i .
After a period of 33 years in exi@@ le , I went back to Lib@@ ya , and with unique en@@ thu@@ si@@ as@@ m , I started organi@@ zing work@@ sho@@ ps on capacity building , on human development of leadership skills .
With an amazing group of women , I co-@@ foun@@ ded the Li@@ by@@ an Women &apos;s P@@ lat@@ form for Pe@@ ace , a movement of women , leaders , from different walks of life , to lob@@ by for the soci@@ op@@ oli@@ tical empo@@ wer@@ ment of women and to lob@@ by for our right for equal particip@@ ation in building democracy and peace .
I met a very difficult environment in the pre-@@ elections , an environment which was increasingly pol@@ ari@@ zed , an environment which was shaped by the sel@@ fish politics of domin@@ ance and ex@@ clu@@ sion .
I led an initi@@ ative by the Li@@ by@@ an Women &apos;s P@@ lat@@ form for Pe@@ ace to lob@@ by for a more inclu@@ sive elec@@ tor@@ al law , a law that would give every citiz@@ en , no matter what your background , the right to vote and run , and most importantly to sti@@ pu@@ late on political par@@ ties the alter@@ nation of male and female candi@@ dates ver@@ tically and hori@@ zon@@ tally in their li@@ sts , creating the zi@@ pper list .
E@@ ven@@ tually , our initi@@ ative was adop@@ ted and successful .
Women won 17@@ .@@ 5 percent of the National Congress in the first elections ever in 5@@ 2 years .
However , bit by bit , the eu@@ ph@@ ori@@ a of the elections , and of the revolution as a whole , was f@@ ading out -- for every day we were wa@@ king up to the news of violence .
One day we wake up to the news of the de@@ sec@@ ration of ancient mos@@ ques and Su@@ f@@ i tom@@ bs .
On another day we wake up to the news of the mur@@ der of the American am@@ bas@@ sa@@ d@@ or and the attack on the con@@ sul@@ ate .
On another day we wake up to the news of the as@@ sa@@ ss@@ ination of army offi@@ cers .
And every day , every day we wake up with the rule of the mili@@ ti@@ as and their continu@@ ous vi@@ o@@ lations of human rights of prison@@ ers and their dis@@ respect of the rule of law .
Our society , shaped by a rev@@ olutionary mind@@ set , became more pol@@ ari@@ zed and has driven away from the ide@@ als and the principles -- freedom , dig@@ nity , social justice -- that we first held .
In@@ toler@@ ance , ex@@ clu@@ sion and reve@@ nge became the i@@ con@@ s of the &#91; after@@ math &#93; of the revolution .
I am here today not at all to inspi@@ re you with our success story of the zi@@ pper list and the elections .
I &apos;m rather here today to conf@@ ess that we as a nation took the wrong choice , made the wrong decision .
We did not pri@@ ori@@ tize right .
For elections did not bring peace and st@@ ability and security in Lib@@ ya .
Did the zi@@ pper list and the alter@@ nation between female and male candi@@ dates bring peace and national recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ation ?
No , it didn &apos;t .
What is it , then ?
Why does our society continue to be pol@@ ari@@ zed and domin@@ ated with sel@@ fish politics of domin@@ ance and ex@@ clu@@ sion , by both men and women ?
Maybe what was missing was not the women only , but the femin@@ ine values of compassion , mer@@ cy and inclu@@ sion .
Our society needs national di@@ alo@@ gue and con@@ sen@@ su@@ s-@@ building more than it needed the elections , which only re@@ in@@ forced pol@@ ari@@ zation and divi@@ sion .
Our society needs the qu@@ al@@ it@@ ative represen@@ tation of the femin@@ ine more than it needs the nu@@ mer@@ ical , quanti@@ tative represen@@ tation of the femin@@ ine .
We need to stop acting as ag@@ ents of ra@@ ge and calling for days of ra@@ ge .
We need to start acting as ag@@ ents of compassion and mer@@ cy .
We need to develop a femin@@ ine dis@@ course that not only hon@@ ors but also imple@@ ments mer@@ cy instead of reve@@ nge , collaboration instead of competition , inclu@@ sion instead of ex@@ clu@@ sion .
These are the ide@@ als that a war@@ -@@ tor@@ n Lib@@ ya needs desper@@ ately in order to achieve peace .
For peace has an al@@ che@@ my , and this al@@ che@@ my is about the inter@@ tw@@ ining , the alter@@ nation between the femin@@ ine and mas@@ cul@@ ine perspec@@ tives .
That &apos;s the real zi@@ pper .
And we need to estab@@ lish that exist@@ entially before we do so soci@@ op@@ oli@@ tically .
Ac@@ cording to a Q@@ ur@@ anic verse &quot; Sal@@ am &quot; -- peace -- &quot; is the word of the al@@ l-@@ mer@@ ci@@ ful God , ra@@ he@@ em . &quot;
In turn , the word &quot; ra@@ he@@ em , &quot; which is known in all Abra@@ ha@@ mic tradi@@ tions , has the same root in Arabic as the word &quot; ra@@ h@@ em &quot; -- wom@@ b -- symbo@@ li@@ zing the mat@@ er@@ nal femin@@ ine en@@ compas@@ sing all humanity from which the male and the female , from which all tribes , all pe@@ op@@ les , have e@@ man@@ ated from .
And so just as the wom@@ b entirely en@@ velo@@ pes the emb@@ ry@@ o , which grows within it , the di@@ v@@ ine ma@@ tri@@ x of compassion n@@ ouri@@ shes the entire existence .
Th@@ us we are told that &quot; My mer@@ cy en@@ compas@@ ses all things . &quot;
Th@@ us we are told that &quot; My mer@@ cy takes prece@@ dence over my anger . &quot;
May we all be granted a gr@@ ace of mer@@ cy .
Thank you .
Five years ago , I experienced a bit of what it must have been like to be Ali@@ ce in W@@ on@@ der@@ land .
Pen@@ n State asked me , a communi@@ cations teacher , to teach a communi@@ cations class for engineering students .
And I was scared .
Really scared . S@@ car@@ ed of these students with their big brains and their big books and their big , un@@ familiar words .
But as these conversations un@@ fol@@ ded , I experienced what Ali@@ ce must have when she went down that r@@ ab@@ bit hole and saw that door to a whole new world .
That &apos;s just how I felt as I had those conversations with the students . I was ama@@ zed at the ideas that they had , and I wanted others to experience this wonder@@ land as well .
And I believe the key to opening that door is great communication .
We desper@@ ately need great communication from our scientists and engineers in order to change the world .
Our scientists and engineers are the ones that are tack@@ ling our gran@@ dest challenges , from energy to environment to health care , among others , and if we don &apos;t know about it and understand it , then the work isn &apos;t done , and I believe it &apos;s our responsibility as non-@@ scientists to have these interactions .
But these great conversations can &apos;t occur if our scientists and engineers don &apos;t invite us in to see their wonder@@ land .
So scientists and engineers , please , talk ner@@ dy to us .
I want to share a few keys on how you can do that to make sure that we can see that your science is se@@ xy and that your engineering is engaging .
First question to answer for us : so what ?
T@@ ell us why your science is relevant to us .
Don &apos;t just tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ecu@@ la@@ e , but tell me that you study tr@@ ab@@ ecu@@ la@@ e , which is the mes@@ h@@ -like structure of our bones because it &apos;s important to understanding and tr@@ eating os@@ te@@ op@@ or@@ os@@ is .
And when you &apos;re descri@@ bing your science , be@@ ware of j@@ ar@@ g@@ on .
J@@ ar@@ g@@ on is a barri@@ er to our understanding of your ideas .
S@@ ure , you can say &quot; spa@@ ti@@ al and temp@@ oral , &quot; but why not just say &quot; space and time , &quot; which is so much more accessible to us ?
And making your ideas accessible is not the same as du@@ mb@@ ing it down .
Instead , as Einstein said , make everything as simple as possible , but no simp@@ ler .
You can clearly communicate your science without comprom@@ ising the ideas .
A few things to consider are having examples , stories and analo@@ gies . Those are ways to engage and exc@@ ite us about your content .
And when presen@@ ting your work , drop the bul@@ let points .
Have you ever wondered why they &apos;re called bul@@ let points ?
What do bul@@ lets do ? B@@ ul@@ lets kill , and they will kill your presentation .
A slide like this is not only boring , but it re@@ lies too much on the language area of our brain , and causes us to become overwhel@@ med .
Instead , this example slide by G@@ ene@@ vie@@ ve Brown is much more effective . It &apos;s showing that the special structure of tr@@ ab@@ ecu@@ la@@ e are so strong that they actually inspired the unique design of the E@@ i@@ ff@@ el To@@ wer .
And the trick here is to use a single , read@@ able sentence that the audience can key into if they get a bit lost , and then provide visu@@ als which appe@@ al to our other senses and create a deeper sense of understanding of what &apos;s being described .
So I think these are just a few keys that can help the rest of us to open that door and see the wonder@@ land that is science and engineering .
And because the engineers that I &apos;ve worked with have taught me to become really in touch with my inner ner@@ d , I want to summar@@ ize with an equation .
Take your science , sub@@ tract your bul@@ let points and your j@@ ar@@ g@@ on , divide by relev@@ ance , meaning share what &apos;s relevant to the audience , and multi@@ p@@ ly it by the passion that you have for this incredible work that you &apos;re doing , and that is going to equal incredible interactions that are full of understanding .
And so , scientists and engineers , when you &apos;ve solved this equation , by all means , talk ner@@ dy to me .
Thank you .
Hi . My name is Cam@@ er@@ on Rus@@ sell , and for the last little while I &apos;ve been a model .
Actually , for 10 years .
And I feel like there &apos;s an un@@ comfortable ten@@ sion in the room right now because I should not have wor@@ n this dre@@ ss .
So lu@@ cki@@ ly I brought an out@@ fit change .
This is the first out@@ fit change on the TED stage , so you guys are pretty lucky to wit@@ ness it , I think .
If some of the women were really horri@@ fied when I came out , you don &apos;t have to tell me now , but I &apos;ll find out later on Twitter .
I &apos;d also note that I &apos;m quite privi@@ leg@@ ed to be able to transform what you think of me in a very bri@@ ef 10 seconds .
Not everybody gets to do that .
These he@@ els are very un@@ comfortable , so good thing I wasn &apos;t going to wear them .
The worst part is putting this swe@@ ater over my head , because that &apos;s when you &apos;ll all laugh at me , so don &apos;t do anything while it &apos;s over my head .
All right .
So why did I do that ?
That was aw@@ k@@ ward .
Well , hopefully not as aw@@ k@@ ward as that picture .
I@@ mage is powerful , but also image is super@@ ficial .
I just totally transformed what you thought of me in six seconds .
And in this picture , I had actually never had a bo@@ y@@ friend in real life .
I was totally un@@ comfortable , and the photograp@@ her was telling me to ar@@ ch my back and put my hand in that guy &apos;s hair .
And of course , bar@@ ring surgery , or the fake tan that I got two days ago for work , there &apos;s very little that we can do to transform how we look , and how we look , though it is super@@ ficial and immu@@ table , has a huge impact on our lives .
So today , for me , being f@@ ear@@ less means being honest .
And I am on this stage because I am a model .
I am on this stage because I am a pretty , white woman , and in my industry we call that a se@@ xy girl .
And I &apos;m going to answer the questions that people always ask me , but with an honest tw@@ ist .
So the first question is , how do you become a model ?
And I always just say , &quot; Oh , I was s@@ cou@@ ted , &quot; but that means nothing .
The real way that I became a model is I won a genetic lot@@ tery , and I am the reci@@ pi@@ ent of a leg@@ acy , and maybe you &apos;re wondering what is a leg@@ acy .
Well , for the past few centuries we have defined beauty not just as health and you@@ th and sym@@ me@@ try that we &apos;re bio@@ logically program@@ med to ad@@ mi@@ re , but also as tall , s@@ len@@ der figures , and femin@@ in@@ ity and white skin .
And this is a leg@@ acy that was built for me , and it &apos;s a leg@@ acy that I &apos;ve been c@@ ash@@ ing out on .
And I know there are people in the audience who are s@@ ke@@ p@@ tical at this point , and maybe there are some fashi@@ oni@@ st@@ as who are , like , &quot; Wa@@ it . Na@@ om@@ i . Ty@@ ra . Jo@@ an S@@ mal@@ ls . Li@@ u W@@ en . &quot;
And first , I comm@@ end you on your model knowledge . Very imp@@ res@@ sive .
But unfortunately I have to in@@ form you that in 2007 , a very inspired N@@ Y@@ U Ph@@ .D. student coun@@ ted all the models on the run@@ way , every single one that was hi@@ red , and of the 6@@ 7@@ 7 models that were hi@@ red , only 27 , or less than four percent , were non-@@ white .
The next question people always ask me is , &quot; Can I be a model when I grow up ? &quot;
And the first answer is , &quot; I don &apos;t know , they don &apos;t put me in charge of that . &quot;
But the second answer , and what I really want to say to these little girls is , &quot; Why ?
You know ? You can be anything .
You could be the President of the United States , or the inven@@ tor of the next Internet , or a n@@ in@@ ja car@@ di@@ o-@@ th@@ or@@ ac@@ ic surgeon po@@ et , which would be awesome , because you &apos;d be the first one . &quot;
If , after this amazing list , they still are like , &quot; No , no , Cam@@ er@@ on , I want to be a model , &quot; well then I say , &quot; Be my b@@ oss . &quot;
Because I &apos;m not in charge of anything , and you could be the edit@@ or in chi@@ ef of American Vo@@ gue or the CEO of H &amp; amp ; M , or the next Ste@@ ven M@@ ei@@ sel .
Sa@@ ying that you want to be a model when you grow up is ak@@ in to saying that you want to win the Po@@ wer@@ ball when you grow up .
It &apos;s out of your control , and it &apos;s awesome , and it &apos;s not a career path .
I will demonstrate for you now 10 years of accu@@ mul@@ ated model knowledge , because unlike car@@ di@@ o-@@ th@@ or@@ ac@@ ic sur@@ ge@@ ons , it can just be di@@ sti@@ l@@ led right into -- right now .
So if the photograp@@ her is right there and the light is right there , like a nice H@@ M@@ I , and the cli@@ ent says , &quot; Cam@@ er@@ on , we want a walking shot , &quot; well then this leg goes first , nice and long , this arm goes back , this arm goes forward , the head is at three quar@@ ters , and you just go back and forth , just do that , and then you look back at your imag@@ inary friends , 300 , 400 , 500 times .
It will look something like this .
Hop@@ e@@ fully less aw@@ k@@ ward than that one in the middle .
That was , I don &apos;t know what happened there .
Unfortunately after you &apos;ve gone to school , and you have a r@@ é@@ sum@@ é and you &apos;ve done a few jobs , you can &apos;t say anything anymore , so if you say you want to be the President of the United States , but your r@@ é@@ sum@@ é reads , &quot; Un@@ der@@ wear Mo@@ del : 10 years , &quot; people give you a funny look .
The next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do they re@@ touch all the photos ? &quot;
And yeah , they pretty much re@@ touch all the photos , but that is only a small component of what &apos;s happening .
This picture is the very first picture that I ever took , and it &apos;s also the very first time that I had wor@@ n a bi@@ kin@@ i , and I didn &apos;t even have my period yet .
I know we &apos;re getting personal , but I was a young girl .
This is what I looked like with my grand@@ ma just a few months earlier .
Here &apos;s me on the same day as this shoot .
My friend got to come with me .
Here &apos;s me at a slu@@ mber party a few days before I shot French Vo@@ gue .
Here &apos;s me on the so@@ c@@ cer team and in V M@@ aga@@ z@@ ine .
And here &apos;s me today .
And I hope what you &apos;re seeing is that these pictures are not pictures of me .
They are construc@@ tions , and they are construc@@ tions by a group of profession@@ als , by ha@@ ir@@ st@@ y@@ li@@ sts and ma@@ ke@@ up artists and photograph@@ ers and st@@ y@@ li@@ sts and all of their assi@@ st@@ ants and pre-@@ production and post-@@ production , and they build this . That &apos;s not me .
Okay , so the next question people always ask me is , &quot; Do you get free stuff ? &quot;
I do have too many 8@@ -@@ inch he@@ els which I never get to wear , except for earlier , but the free stuff that I get is the free stuff that I get in real life , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t like to talk about .
I grew up in Cambridge , and one time I went into a store and I for@@ got my money and they gave me the dre@@ ss for free .
When I was a teen@@ ager , I was driving with my friend who was an awful driver and she ran a red and of course , we got pulled over , and all it took was a &quot; S@@ or@@ ry , offi@@ cer , &quot; and we were on our way .
And I got these free things because of how I look , not who I am , and there are people paying a cost for how they look and not who they are .
I live in New York , and last year , of the 14@@ 0,000 teenagers that were stopped and fri@@ s@@ ked , 8@@ 6 percent of them were black and La@@ ti@@ no , and most of them were young men .
And there are only 17@@ 7@@ ,000 young black and La@@ ti@@ no men in New York , so for them , it &apos;s not a question of , &quot; Will I get stopped ? &quot;
but &quot; How many times will I get stopped ? When will I get stopped ? &quot;
When I was resear@@ ching this talk , I found out that of the 1@@ 3@@ -year-old girls in the United States , 5@@ 3 percent don &apos;t like their bodies , and that number goes to 7@@ 8 percent by the time that they &apos;re 17 .
So the last question people ask me is , &quot; What is it like to be a model ? &quot;
And I think the answer that they &apos;re looking for is , &quot; If you are a little bit sk@@ in@@ ni@@ er and you have sh@@ ini@@ er hair , you will be so happy and fab@@ ulous . &quot;
And when we &apos;re back@@ stage , we give an answer that maybe makes it seem like that .
We say , &quot; It &apos;s really amazing to travel , and it &apos;s amazing to get to work with creative , inspired , passionate people . &quot;
And those things are true , but they &apos;re only one half of the story , because the thing that we never say on camera , that I have never said on camera , is , &quot; I am in@@ secure . &quot;
And I &apos;m in@@ secure because I have to think about what I look like every day .
And if you ever are wondering , &quot; If I have thin@@ ner thi@@ gh@@ s and sh@@ ini@@ er hair , will I be happier ? &quot;
you just need to meet a group of models , because they have the thin@@ ne@@ st thi@@ gh@@ s and the sh@@ ini@@ est hair and the coo@@ lest clothes , and they &apos;re the most physically in@@ secure women probably on the planet .
So when I was writing this talk , I found it very difficult to stri@@ ke an honest balance , because on the one hand , I felt very un@@ comfortable to come out here and say , &quot; Look I &apos;ve received all these benefits from a dec@@ k st@@ acked in my fav@@ or , &quot; and it also felt really un@@ comfortable to follow that up with , &quot; and it doesn &apos;t always make me happy . &quot;
But mostly it was difficult to un@@ pack a leg@@ acy of gender and rac@@ ial op@@ pression when I am one of the biggest bene@@ fi@@ ci@@ aries .
But I &apos;m also happy and hon@@ o@@ red to be up here and I think that it &apos;s great that I got to come before 10 or 20 or 30 years had passed and I &apos;d had more ag@@ ency in my career , because maybe then I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I got my first job , or maybe I wouldn &apos;t tell the story of how I paid for college , which seems so important right now .
If there &apos;s a ta@@ k@@ ea@@ way to this talk , I hope it &apos;s that we all feel more comfortable ac@@ knowle@@ d@@ ging the power of image in our percei@@ ved success@@ es and our percei@@ ved fail@@ ures .
Thank you .
There are a lot of ways the people around us can help improve our lives .
We don &apos;t bu@@ mp into every neighb@@ or , so a lot of wisdom never gets passed on , though we do share the same public spaces .
So over the past few years , I &apos;ve tried ways to share more with my neighbors in public space , using simple tools like sti@@ ck@@ ers , st@@ en@@ c@@ ils and ch@@ al@@ k .
And these projects came from questions I had , like , how much are my neighbors paying for their apart@@ ments ?
How can we l@@ end and bor@@ row more things without kno@@ cking on each other &apos;s doors at a bad time ?
How can we share more of our memories of our ab@@ and@@ oned buildings , and gain a better understanding of our landscape ?
And how can we share more of our ho@@ pes for our vac@@ ant sto@@ re@@ fron@@ ts , so our communities can refl@@ ect our needs and dreams today ?
Now , I live in New Or@@ le@@ ans , and I am in love with New Or@@ le@@ ans .
My soul is always so@@ o@@ the@@ d by the giant live o@@ ak trees , sha@@ ding lo@@ vers , dr@@ un@@ ks and dre@@ am@@ ers for hundreds of years , and I trust a city that always makes way for music .
I feel like every time someone s@@ nee@@ zes , New Or@@ le@@ ans has a par@@ ade .
The city has some of the most beautiful architecture in the world , but it also has one of the highest amounts of ab@@ and@@ oned properties in America .
I live near this house , and I thought about how I could make it a nic@@ er space for my neighborhood , and I also thought about something that changed my life forever .
In 2009 , I lost someone I loved very much .
Her name was Jo@@ an , and she was a mother to me , and her death was sudden and unexpected .
And I thought about death a lot , and this made me feel deep gra@@ titude for the time I &apos;ve had , and brought c@@ lar@@ ity to the things that are meaningful to my life now .
But I struggle to maintain this perspective in my daily life .
I feel like it &apos;s easy to get caught up in the da@@ y-@@ to-@@ day , and forget what really matters to you .
So with help from old and new friends , I turned the side of this ab@@ and@@ oned house into a giant ch@@ al@@ k@@ board and st@@ en@@ c@@ iled it with a fil@@ l-@@ in-@@ the-@@ bl@@ ank sentence : &quot; Before I die , I want to ... &quot; So anyone walking by can pick up a piece of ch@@ al@@ k , refl@@ ect on their lives , and share their personal as@@ pi@@ ra@@ tions in public space .
I didn &apos;t know what to expect from this experiment , but by the next day , the wall was entirely filled out , and it kept growing .
And I &apos;d like to share a few things that people wrote on this wall .
&quot; Before I die , I want to be tried for p@@ ir@@ acy . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to str@@ ad@@ dle the International D@@ ate Line . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to sing for millions . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to plant a tree . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to live off the grid . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to hold her one more time . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be someone &apos;s ca@@ val@@ ry . &quot;
&quot; Before I die , I want to be completely myself . &quot;
So this ne@@ gl@@ ected space became a construc@@ tive one , and people &apos;s ho@@ pes and dreams made me laugh out loud , t@@ ear up , and they con@@ sol@@ ed me during my own tough times .
It &apos;s about knowing you &apos;re not alone .
It &apos;s about understanding our neighbors in new and en@@ li@@ ghten@@ ing ways .
It &apos;s about making space for refl@@ ection and con@@ temp@@ lation , and rememb@@ ering what really matters most to us as we grow and change .
I made this last year , and started recei@@ ving hundreds of messages from passionate people who wanted to make a wall with their community , so my civi@@ c center colleagues and I made a tool k@@ it , and now walls have been made in countries around the world , including Ka@@ z@@ a@@ kh@@ stan , South Africa , Australia , Argenti@@ na and beyond .
To@@ gether , we &apos;ve shown how powerful our public spaces can be if we &apos;re given the opportunity to have a voice and share more with one another .
Two of the most valuable things we have are time and our relationships with other people .
In our age of increasing distr@@ actions , it &apos;s more important than ever to find ways to maintain perspective and remember that life is bri@@ ef and ten@@ der .
De@@ ath is something that we &apos;re often dis@@ coura@@ ged to talk about or even think about , but I &apos;ve realized that prepar@@ ing for death is one of the most empo@@ wering things you can do .
Th@@ in@@ king about death c@@ lar@@ i@@ fi@@ es your life .
Our shared spaces can better refl@@ ect what matters to us as individuals and as a community , and with more ways to share our ho@@ pes , fears and stories , the people around us can not only help us make better places , they can help us lead better lives .
Thank you .
Thank you .
So , well , I do applied math , and this is a p@@ ecu@@ liar problem for anyone who does applied math , is that we are like management con@@ sul@@ tan@@ ts .
No one knows what the hell we do .
So I am going to give you some -- attempt today to try and explain to you what I do .
So , dancing is one of the most human of activities .
We de@@ light at bal@@ let virtu@@ os@@ os and ta@@ p dan@@ cers you will see later on .
Now , bal@@ let requires an extraordinary level of exper@@ ti@@ se and a high level of skill , and probably a level of initi@@ al su@@ it@@ ability that may well have a genetic component to it .
Now , sa@@ dly , neuro@@ logical dis@@ orders such as Parkinson &apos;s disease gradu@@ ally destroy this extraordinary ability , as it is doing to my friend J@@ an S@@ tri@@ pl@@ ing , who was a virtu@@ os@@ o bal@@ let dan@@ cer in his time .
So great progress and treatment has been made over the years .
However , there are 6@@ .@@ 3 million people worldwide who have the disease , and they have to live with in@@ cur@@ able wea@@ kness , tre@@ mor , ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity and the other symptoms that go along with the disease , so what we need are ob@@ jective tools to detect the disease before it &apos;s too late .
We need to be able to measure progre@@ ssion ob@@ jec@@ tively , and ultimately , the only way we &apos;re going to know when we actually have a cure is when we have an ob@@ jective measure that can answer that for sure .
But fru@@ stra@@ ti@@ ngly , with Parkinson &apos;s disease and other movement dis@@ orders , there are no bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers , so there &apos;s no simple blood test that you can do , and the best that we have is like this 20@@ -@@ minute neuro@@ logist test .
You have to go to the clin@@ ic to do it . It &apos;s very , very cos@@ tly , and that means that , outside the clinical trials , it &apos;s just never done . It &apos;s never done .
But what if patients could do this test at home ?
Now , that would actually save on a difficult trip to the clin@@ ic , and what if patients could do that test themselves , right ?
No expensive staff time required .
Ta@@ kes about $ 300 , by the way , in the neuro@@ logist &apos;s clin@@ ic to do it .
So what I want to pro@@ pose to you as an un@@ conventional way in which we can try to achieve this , because , you see , in one sense , at least , we are all virtu@@ os@@ os like my friend J@@ an S@@ tri@@ pl@@ ing .
So here we have a video of the vibra@@ ting vo@@ cal fol@@ ds .
Now , this is healthy and this is somebody making speech sounds , and we can think of ourselves as vo@@ cal bal@@ let dan@@ cers , because we have to coordin@@ ate all of these vo@@ cal organs when we make sounds , and we all actually have the genes for it . F@@ ox@@ P@@ 2 , for example .
And like bal@@ let , it takes an extraordinary level of training .
I mean , just think how long it takes a child to learn to speak .
From the sound , we can actually track the vo@@ cal fold position as it vi@@ br@@ ates , and just as the li@@ mb@@ s are affected in Parkinson &apos;s , so too are the vo@@ cal organs .
So on the bottom tr@@ ace , you can see an example of ir@@ regular vo@@ cal fold tre@@ mor .
We see all the same symptoms .
We see vo@@ cal tre@@ mor , wea@@ kness and ri@@ gi@@ d@@ ity .
The speech actually becomes qui@@ e@@ ter and more brea@@ thy after a while , and that &apos;s one of the example symptoms of it .
So these vo@@ cal effects can actually be quite sub@@ tle , in some cases , but with any digital micro@@ phone , and using preci@@ sion voice analysis software in combination with the latest in machine learning , which is very advanced by now , we can now quanti@@ fy exactly where somebody lies on a continu@@ um between health and disease using voice signals alone .
So these vo@@ ic@@ e-@@ based tests , how do they st@@ ack up against expert clinical tests ? We &apos;ll , they &apos;re both non-@@ inv@@ a@@ sive .
The neuro@@ logist &apos;s test is non-@@ inv@@ a@@ sive . They both use existing infrastructure .
You don &apos;t have to design a whole new set of hospitals to do it .
And they &apos;re both accurate . Okay , but in addition , vo@@ ic@@ e-@@ based tests are non-@@ expert .
That means they can be self-@@ admini@@ ster@@ ed .
They &apos;re high-@@ speed , take about 30 seconds at most .
They &apos;re ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low cost , and we all know what happens .
When something becomes ul@@ tra@@ -@@ low cost , it becomes mas@@ sively scal@@ able .
So here are some amazing goals that I think we can deal with now .
We can reduce logi@@ sti@@ cal difficul@@ ties with patients .
No need to go to the clin@@ ic for a rou@@ ti@@ ne chec@@ k@@ up .
We can do high-@@ frequ@@ ency monit@@ oring to get ob@@ jective data .
We can perform low-@@ cost mass rec@@ ru@@ it@@ ment for clinical trials , and we can make popu@@ la@@ tion-@@ scale scre@@ ening f@@ ea@@ sible for the first time .
We have the opportunity to start to search for the early bi@@ om@@ ar@@ kers of the disease before it &apos;s too late .
So , taking the first steps towards this today , we &apos;re laun@@ ching the Parkinson &apos;s Vo@@ ice I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative .
With A@@ cu@@ lab and Pa@@ ti@@ en@@ t@@ s@@ Li@@ ke@@ M@@ e , we &apos;re a@@ im@@ ing to record a very large number of voices worldwide to collect enough data to start to tack@@ le these four goals .
We have local numbers accessible to three quar@@ ters of a billion people on the planet .
Any@@ one healthy or with Parkinson &apos;s can call in , che@@ ap@@ ly , and leave recor@@ dings , a few cents each , and I &apos;m really happy to announ@@ ce that we &apos;ve already hit six percent of our target just in eight hours .
Thank you .
So Ma@@ x , by taking all these samples of , let &apos;s say , 10,000 people , you &apos;ll be able to tell who &apos;s healthy and who &apos;s not ?
What are you going to get out of those samples ?
Yeah . Yeah . So what will happen is that , during the call you have to indic@@ ate whether or not you have the disease or not , you see . Right .
You see , some people may not do it . They may not get through it .
But we &apos;ll get a very large sample of data that is collected from all different circumstances , and it &apos;s getting it in different circumstances that matter because then we are looking at ir@@ on@@ ing out the conf@@ oun@@ ding factors , and looking for the actual mark@@ ers of the disease .
So you &apos;re 8@@ 6 percent accurate right now ?
It &apos;s much better than that .
Actually , my student Th@@ an@@ as@@ is , I have to plu@@ g him , because he &apos;s done some fantastic work , and now he has pro@@ ved that it works over the mobile tele@@ phone network as well , which en@@ ables this project , and we &apos;re getting 99 percent accur@@ acy .
N@@ ine@@ ty-@@ nine . Well , that &apos;s an impro@@ vement .
So what that means is that people will be able to — People will be able to call in from their mobile phones and do this test , and people with Parkinson &apos;s could call in , record their voice , and then their doctor can check up on their progress , see where they &apos;re doing in this course of the disease .
Ab@@ solu@@ tely .
Thanks so much . Ma@@ x L@@ it@@ tle , everybody .
Thanks , Tom .
I live in South Central .
This is South Central : liqu@@ or sto@@ res , fast food , vac@@ ant lots .
So the city plan@@ ners , they get together and they figure they &apos;re going to change the name South Central to make it represent something else , so they change it to South Los Angeles , like this is going to fix what &apos;s really going wrong in the city .
This is South Los Angeles .
Li@@ qu@@ or sto@@ res , fast food , vac@@ ant lots .
Just like 2@@ 6@@ .@@ 5 million other Americans , I live in a food desert , South Central Los Angeles , home of the dri@@ ve-@@ th@@ r@@ u and the dri@@ ve-@@ by .
F@@ un@@ ny thing is , the dri@@ ve-@@ th@@ rus are killing more people than the dri@@ ve-@@ b@@ ys .
People are dying from cur@@ able diseases in South Central Los Angeles .
For instance , the obesity rate in my neighborhood is five times higher than , say , Be@@ ver@@ ly H@@ ills , which is probably eight , 10 miles away .
I got ti@@ red of seeing this happening .
And I was wondering , how would you feel if you had no access to healthy food , if every time you walk out your door you see the ill effects that the present food system has on your neighborhood ?
I see wheel@@ chairs bought and sold like used cars .
I see di@@ aly@@ sis centers pop@@ ping up like Star@@ bucks .
And I figured , this has to stop .
So I figured that the problem is the solution .
F@@ ood is the problem and food is the solution .
P@@ lus I got ti@@ red of driving 45 minutes round trip to get an apple that wasn &apos;t impre@@ gn@@ ated with pe@@ sti@@ ci@@ des .
So what I did , I plan@@ ted a food forest in front of my house .
It was on a stri@@ p of land that we call a par@@ k@@ way .
It &apos;s 150 feet by 10 feet .
Th@@ ing is , it &apos;s ow@@ ned by the city .
But you have to maintain it .
So I &apos;m like , &quot; Co@@ ol . I can do whatever the hell I want , since it &apos;s my responsibility and I got@@ ta maintain it . &quot;
And this is how I decided to maintain it .
So me and my group , L.@@ A. Green G@@ roun@@ ds , we got together and we started plan@@ ting my food forest , fru@@ it trees , you know , the whole nine , vege@@ tables .
What we do , we &apos;re a pa@@ y-@@ it@@ -@@ forward kind of group , where it &apos;s compos@@ ed of gar@@ den@@ ers from all walks of life , from all over the city , and it &apos;s completely volunte@@ er , and everything we do is free .
And the garden , it was beautiful .
And then somebody compla@@ ined .
The city came down on me , and basically gave me a c@@ itation saying that I had to remove my garden , which this c@@ itation was turning into a war@@ r@@ ant .
And I &apos;m like , &quot; Come on , really ?
A war@@ r@@ ant for plan@@ ting food on a piece of land that you could care less about ? &quot;
And I was like , &quot; Co@@ ol . B@@ ring it . &quot;
Because this time it wasn &apos;t coming up .
So L.@@ A. Times got a@@ hold of it . Steve L@@ op@@ e@@ z did a story on it and talked to the coun@@ c@@ il@@ man , and one of the Green G@@ roun@@ ds members , they put up a pe@@ ti@@ tion on Ch@@ an@@ ge@@ .@@ or@@ g , and with 9@@ 00 sig@@ nat@@ ures , we were a success .
We had a vic@@ tory on our hands .
My coun@@ c@@ il@@ man even called in and said how they end@@ or@@ se and love what we &apos;re doing .
I mean , come on , why wouldn &apos;t they ?
L.@@ A. leads the United States in vac@@ ant lots that the city actually ow@@ ns .
They own 26 square miles of vac@@ ant lots .
That &apos;s 20 Central Par@@ ks .
That &apos;s enough space to plant 7@@ 25 million tom@@ a@@ to plants .
Why in the hell would they not okay this ?
G@@ ro@@ wing one plant will give you 1,000 , 10,000 seeds .
When one dollar &apos;s worth of green be@@ ans will give you 75 dollars &apos; worth of produce .
It &apos;s my g@@ os@@ pe@@ l , when I &apos;m telling people , grow your own food .
G@@ ro@@ wing your own food is like printing your own money .
See , I have a leg@@ acy in South Central .
I grew up there . I raised my sons there .
And I refu@@ se to be a part of this manufac@@ tured reality that was manufac@@ tured for me by some other people , and I &apos;m manufacturing my own reality .
See , I &apos;m an artist .
Gar@@ den@@ ing is my gra@@ ff@@ iti . I grow my art .
Just like a gra@@ ff@@ iti artist , where they beauti@@ fy walls , me , I beautiful law@@ ns , par@@ k@@ ways .
I use the garden , the soil , like it &apos;s a piece of cl@@ oth , and the plants and the trees , that &apos;s my emb@@ el@@ li@@ sh@@ ment for that cl@@ oth .
You &apos;d be surprised what the soil could do if you let it be your can@@ v@@ as .
You just couldn &apos;t imagine how amazing a sun@@ flower is and how it aff@@ ects people .
So what happened ?
I have wit@@ ne@@ ssed my garden become a tool for the education , a tool for the transformation of my neighborhood .
To change the community , you have to change the compos@@ ition of the soil .
We are the soil .
You &apos;d be surprised how kids are affected by this .
Gar@@ den@@ ing is the most therap@@ eu@@ tic and de@@ fi@@ ant act you can do , especially in the inner city .
P@@ lus you get str@@ aw@@ ber@@ ries .
I remember this time , there was this mother and a daughter came , it was , like , 10 : 30 at night , and they were in my yard , and I came out and they looked so as@@ ha@@ med .
So I &apos;m like , man , it made me feel bad that they were there , and I told them , you know , you don &apos;t have to do this like this .
This is on the street for a reason .
It made me feel as@@ ha@@ med to see people that were this close to me that were hungry , and this only re@@ in@@ forced why I do this , and people asked me , &quot; F@@ in , aren &apos;t you afraid people are going to ste@@ al your food ? &quot;
And I &apos;m like , &quot; H@@ ell no , I ain &apos;t afraid they &apos;re gon@@ na ste@@ al it .
That &apos;s why it &apos;s on the street .
That &apos;s the whole idea .
I want them to take it , but at the same time , I want them to take back their health . &quot;
There &apos;s another time when I put a garden in this hom@@ eless shel@@ ter in down@@ town Los Angeles .
These are the guys , they helped me un@@ load the truck .
It was cool , and they just shared the stories about how this affected them and how they used to plant with their mother and their grandmother , and it was just cool to see how this changed them , if it was only for that one moment .
So Green G@@ roun@@ ds has gone on to plant maybe 20 gar@@ den@@ s .
We &apos;ve had , like , 50 people come to our dig@@ -@@ ins and participate , and it &apos;s all volunteers .
If kids grow k@@ ale , kids eat k@@ ale .
If they grow tom@@ at@@ oes , they eat tom@@ at@@ oes .
But when none of this is presented to them , if they &apos;re not shown how food aff@@ ects the mind and the body , they blin@@ dly eat whatever the hell you put in front of them .
I see young people and they want to work , but they &apos;re in this thing where they &apos;re caught up -- I see kids of color and they &apos;re just on this track that &apos;s designed for them , that leads them to nowhere .
So with gar@@ den@@ ing , I see an opportunity where we can train these kids to take over their communities , to have a sustainable life .
And when we do this , who knows ?
We might produce the next George Washington Car@@ ver .
but if we don &apos;t change the compos@@ ition of the soil , we will never do this .
Now this is one of my plans . This is what I want to do .
I want to plant a whole block of gar@@ den@@ s where people can share in the food in the same block .
I want to take shi@@ pping con@@ tain@@ ers and turn them into healthy ca@@ f@@ es .
Now don &apos;t get me wrong .
I &apos;m not talking about no free sh@@ it , because free is not sustainable .
The funny thing about sustainability , you have to susta@@ in it .
What I &apos;m talking about is putting people to work , and getting kids off the street , and letting them know the joy , the pri@@ de and the honor in growing your own food , opening far@@ mer &apos;s markets .
So what I want to do here , we got@@ ta make this se@@ xy .
So I want us all to become ec@@ olutionary r@@ ene@@ g@@ ades , g@@ ang@@ st@@ as , g@@ ang@@ st@@ a gar@@ den@@ ers .
We got@@ ta fli@@ p the s@@ cript on what a g@@ ang@@ st@@ a is .
If you ain &apos;t a gar@@ den@@ er , you ain &apos;t g@@ ang@@ st@@ a .
Get g@@ ang@@ st@@ a with your sho@@ vel , okay ?
And let that be your weap@@ on of choice .
So basically , if you want to meet with me , you know , if you want to meet , don &apos;t call me if you want to sit around in cu@@ shy chairs and have meetings where you talk about doing some sh@@ it -- where you talk about doing some sh@@ it .
If you want to meet with me , come to the garden with your sho@@ vel so we can plant some sh@@ it .
Pe@@ ace . Thank you .
Thank you .
This is where I live . I live in Kenya , at the south parts of the Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi National Park .
Those are my dad &apos;s co@@ ws at the back , and behind the co@@ ws , that &apos;s the Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi National Park .
Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi National Park is not f@@ enced in the south wide@@ ly , which means wild animals like ze@@ br@@ as migr@@ ate out of the park free@@ ly .
So pred@@ ators like li@@ ons follow them , and this is what they do .
They kill our li@@ ve@@ stock .
This is one of the co@@ ws which was killed at night , and I just wo@@ ke up in the morning and I found it dead , and I felt so bad , because it was the only bu@@ ll we had .
My community , the Ma@@ a@@ sai , we believe that we came from hea@@ ven with all our animals and all the land for her@@ ding them , and that &apos;s why we value them so much .
So I grew up ha@@ ting li@@ ons so much .
The mor@@ ans are the war@@ ri@@ ors who protect our community and the li@@ ve@@ stock , and they &apos;re also up@@ set about this problem .
So they kill the li@@ ons .
It &apos;s one of the six li@@ ons which were killed in Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi .
And I think this is why the Na@@ i@@ ro@@ bi National Park li@@ ons are few .
So a boy , from six to nine years old , in my community is responsible for his dad &apos;s co@@ ws , and that &apos;s the same thing which happened to me .
So I had to find a way of solving this problem .
And the first idea I got was to use fire , because I thought li@@ ons were scared of fire .
But I came to realize that that didn &apos;t really help , because it was even helping the li@@ ons to see through the co@@ w@@ shed .
So I didn &apos;t give up . I continued .
And a second idea I got was to use a scar@@ ec@@ row .
I was trying to trick the li@@ ons &#91; into thinking &#93; that I was standing near the co@@ w@@ shed .
But li@@ ons are very clever .
They will come the first day and they see the scar@@ ec@@ row , and they go back , but the second day , they &apos;ll come and they say , this thing is not moving here , it &apos;s always here .
So he ju@@ mps in and kil@@ ls the animals .
So one night , I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed with a tor@@ ch , and that day , the li@@ ons didn &apos;t come .
And I discovered that li@@ ons are afraid of a moving light .
So I had an idea .
Since I was a small boy , I used to work in my room for the whole day , and I even took apart my mom &apos;s new radio , and that day she almost killed me , but I learned a lot about electron@@ ics .
So I got an old car battery , an indic@@ ator box . It &apos;s a small device found in a mot@@ or@@ cycle , and it helps mot@@ ori@@ sts when they want to turn right or left . It blin@@ ks .
And I got a switch where I can switch on the lights , on and off .
And that &apos;s a small tor@@ ch from a broken fla@@ sh@@ light .
So I set up everything .
As you can see , the solar pan@@ el char@@ ges the battery , and the battery supp@@ lies the power to the small indic@@ ator box . I call it a transfor@@ mer .
And the indic@@ ator box makes the lights fla@@ sh .
As you can see , the bul@@ bs face outside , because that &apos;s where the li@@ ons come from .
And that &apos;s how it looks to li@@ ons when they come at night .
The lights fla@@ sh and trick the li@@ ons into thinking I was walking around the co@@ w@@ shed , but I was sleep@@ ing in my bed .
Thanks .
So I set it up in my home two years ago , and since then , we have never experienced any problem with li@@ ons .
And my neighbor@@ ing homes heard about this idea .
One of them was this grandmother .
She had a lot of her animals being killed by li@@ ons , and she asked me if I could put the lights for her .
And I said , &quot; Yes . &quot;
So I put the lights . You can see at the back , those are the li@@ on lights .
Since now , I &apos;ve set up seven homes around my community , and they &apos;re really working .
And my idea is also being used now all over Kenya for scar@@ ing other pred@@ ators like hy@@ en@@ as , le@@ op@@ ards , and it &apos;s also being used to s@@ care eleph@@ ants away from people &apos;s far@@ ms .
Because of this invention , I was lucky to get a s@@ chol@@ ar@@ ship in one of the best schools in Kenya , Broo@@ kh@@ ouse International School , and I &apos;m really excited about this .
My new school now is coming in and helping by fun@@ dra@@ ising and creating an awareness .
I even took my friends back to my community , and we &apos;re instal@@ ling the lights to the homes which don &apos;t have &#91; any &#93; , and I &apos;m teaching them how to put them .
So one year ago , I was just a boy in the sa@@ van@@ na gras@@ s@@ land her@@ ding my father &apos;s co@@ ws , and I used to see planes flying over , and I told myself that one day , I &apos;ll be there inside .
And here I am today .
I got a chance to come by plane for my first time for TED .
So my big dream is to become an air@@ craft engineer and pilot when I grow up .
I used to hate li@@ ons , but now because my invention is saving my father &apos;s co@@ ws and the li@@ ons , we are able to stay with the li@@ ons without any conflict .
A@@ sh@@ ê ol@@ ên . It means in my language , thank you very much .
You have no idea how exciting it is to hear a story like y@@ ours .
So you got this s@@ chol@@ ar@@ ship . Y@@ ep .
You &apos;re working on other electrical inven@@ tions .
What &apos;s the next one on your list ?
My next invention is , I want to make an electric f@@ ence . E@@ lec@@ tric f@@ ence ?
But I know electric f@@ ences are already invented , but I want to make mine .
You already tried it once , right , and you -- I tried it before , but I stopped because it gave me a shock .
In the tr@@ en@@ ches . Richard Tur@@ ere , you are something else .
We &apos;re going to che@@ er you on every step of the way , my friend .
Thank you so much . Thank you .
Everything I do , and everything I do profession@@ ally -- my life -- has been shaped by seven years of work as a young man in Africa .
From 197@@ 1 to 197@@ 7 -- I look young , but I &apos;m not — -- I worked in Z@@ am@@ bia , Kenya , I@@ v@@ ory Co@@ ast , Al@@ g@@ eria , Som@@ alia , in projects of technical cooperation with African countries .
I worked for an Ital@@ ian NG@@ O , and every single project that we set up in Africa failed .
And I was distr@@ aught .
I thought , age 21 , that we Ital@@ i@@ ans were good people and we were doing good work in Africa .
Instead , everything we touched we killed .
Our first project , the one that has inspired my first book , &quot; Ri@@ p@@ ples from the Z@@ am@@ be@@ z@@ i , &quot; was a project where we Ital@@ i@@ ans decided to teach Z@@ ambi@@ an people how to grow food .
So we arrived there with Ital@@ ian seeds in sou@@ thern Z@@ am@@ bia in this absolutely mag@@ nifi@@ cent val@@ ley going down to the Z@@ am@@ be@@ z@@ i Ri@@ ver , and we taught the local people how to grow Ital@@ ian tom@@ at@@ oes and z@@ u@@ c@@ ch@@ in@@ i and ...
And of course the local people had absolutely no interest in doing that , so we paid them to come and work , and sometimes they would show up .
And we were ama@@ zed that the local people , in such a fer@@ tile val@@ ley , would not have any agriculture .
But instead of asking them how come they were not growing anything , we simply said , &quot; Thank God we &apos;re here . &quot;
&quot; Just in the n@@ ick of time to save the Z@@ ambi@@ an people from star@@ vation . &quot;
And of course , everything in Africa grew beauti@@ fully .
We had these mag@@ nifi@@ cent tom@@ at@@ oes . In Ital@@ y , a tom@@ a@@ to would grow to this size . In Z@@ am@@ bia , to this size .
And we could not believe , and we were telling the Z@@ ambi@@ ans , &quot; Look how easy agriculture is . &quot;
When the tom@@ at@@ oes were nice and ri@@ pe and red , over@@ night , some 200 hi@@ p@@ po@@ s came out from the river and they ate everything .
And we said to the Z@@ ambi@@ ans , &quot; My God , the hi@@ p@@ po@@ s ! &quot;
And the Z@@ ambi@@ ans said , &quot; Yes , that &apos;s why we have no agriculture here . &quot;
&quot; Why didn &apos;t you tell us ? &quot; &quot; You never asked . &quot;
I thought it was only us Ital@@ i@@ ans bl@@ under@@ ing around Africa , but then I saw what the Americans were doing , what the English were doing , what the French were doing , and after seeing what they were doing , I became quite proud of our project in Z@@ am@@ bia .
Because , you see , at least we fed the hi@@ p@@ po@@ s .
You should see the ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh — -- You should see the ru@@ b@@ bi@@ sh that we have be@@ sto@@ wed on un@@ su@@ spec@@ ting African people .
You want to read the book , read &quot; D@@ ead A@@ id , &quot; by D@@ ambi@@ sa Mo@@ y@@ o , Z@@ ambi@@ an woman econom@@ ist .
The book was published in 2009 .
We Western don@@ or countries have given the African continent two trillion American dollars in the last 50 years .
I &apos;m not going to tell you the damage that that money has done .
Just go and read her book .
R@@ ead it from an African woman , the damage that we have done .
We Western people are imp@@ eri@@ alist , col@@ oni@@ alist mis@@ sion@@ aries , and there are only two ways we deal with people : We either pa@@ tr@@ oni@@ ze them , or we are pat@@ er@@ n@@ al@@ istic .
The two words come from the Latin root &quot; p@@ ater , &quot; which means &quot; father . &quot;
But they mean two different things .
P@@ at@@ er@@ n@@ al@@ istic , I treat anybody from a different culture as if they were my children . &quot; I love you so much . &quot;
Pa@@ tr@@ oni@@ zing , I treat everybody from another culture as if they were my ser@@ v@@ ants .
That &apos;s why the white people in Africa are called &quot; b@@ wan@@ a , &quot; b@@ oss .
I was given a sla@@ p in the face reading a book , &quot; Sm@@ all is Be@@ auti@@ ful , &quot; written by S@@ chu@@ mach@@ er , who said , above all in economic development , if people do not wish to be helped , leave them alone .
This should be the first principle of aid .
The first principle of aid is respect .
This morning , the gentle@@ man who opened this conference lay a stick on the floor , and said , &quot; Can we -- can you imagine a city that is not ne@@ o@@ col@@ on@@ ial ? &quot;
I decided when I was 27 years old to only respond to people , and I invented a system called En@@ ter@@ pri@@ se F@@ aci@@ li@@ tation , where you never initi@@ ate anything , you never motiv@@ ate anybody , but you become a ser@@ v@@ ant of the local passion , the ser@@ v@@ ant of local people who have a dream to become a better person .
So what you do -- you shut up .
You never arri@@ ve in a community with any ideas , and you sit with the local people .
We don &apos;t work from offi@@ ces .
We meet at the ca@@ fe . We meet at the pu@@ b .
We have zero infrastructure .
And what we do , we become friends , and we find out what that person wants to do .
The most important thing is passion .
You can give somebody an idea .
If that person doesn &apos;t want to do it , what are you going to do ?
The passion that the person has for her own growth is the most important thing .
The passion that that man has for his own personal growth is the most important thing .
And then we help them to go and find the knowledge , because nobody in the world can succeed alone .
The person with the idea may not have the knowledge , but the knowledge is available .
So years and years ago , I had this idea : Why don &apos;t we , for once , instead of arri@@ ving in the community to tell people what to do , why don &apos;t , for once , listen to them ? But not in community meetings .
Let me tell you a secret .
There is a problem with community meetings .
En@@ treprene@@ urs never come , and they never tell you , in a public meeting , what they want to do with their own money , what opportunity they have identi@@ fied .
So planning has this blind spot .
The smar@@ test people in your community you don &apos;t even know , because they don &apos;t come to your public meetings .
What we do , we work one-@@ on-@@ one , and to work one-@@ on-@@ one , you have to create a social infrastructure that doesn &apos;t exist .
You have to create a new profes@@ sion .
The profes@@ sion is the family doctor of enter@@ pri@@ se , the family doctor of business , who s@@ its with you in your house , at your kitchen table , at the ca@@ fe , and helps you find the resources to transform your passion into a way to make a living .
I started this as a tr@@ y@@ out in Es@@ per@@ ance , in Western Australia .
I was a doing a Ph@@ .D. at the time , trying to go away from this pa@@ tr@@ oni@@ zing bul@@ l@@ sh@@ it that we arri@@ ve and tell you what to do .
And so what I did in Es@@ per@@ ance that first year was to just walk the streets , and in three days I had my first cli@@ ent , and I helped this first guy who was smo@@ king fish from a gar@@ age , was a Ma@@ or@@ i guy , and I helped him to sell to the restaurant in Per@@ th , to get organized , and then the fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men came to me to say , &quot; You the guy who helped Ma@@ or@@ i ? Can you help us ? &quot;
And I helped these five fi@@ sh@@ er@@ men to work together and get this beautiful tun@@ a not to the can@@ n@@ ery in Al@@ b@@ any for 60 cents a kil@@ o , but we found a way to take the fish for su@@ sh@@ i to Japan for 15 dollars a kil@@ o , and the farmers came to talk to me , said , &quot; Hey , you helped them . Can you help us ? &quot;
In a year , I had 27 projects going on , and the government came to see me to say , &quot; How can you do that ?
How can you do — ? &quot; And I said , &quot; I do something very , very , very difficult .
I shut up , and listen to them . &quot;
So — — So the government says , &quot; Do it again . &quot;
We &apos;ve done it in 300 communities around the world .
We have helped to start 4@@ 0,000 businesses .
There is a new generation of entrepreneurs who are dying of soli@@ tu@@ de .
Peter D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er , one of the greatest management con@@ sul@@ tan@@ ts in history , died age 96 , a few years ago .
Peter D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er was a professor of philosophy before becoming involved in business , and this is what Peter D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er says : &quot; P@@ lan@@ ning is actually in@@ comp@@ a@@ ti@@ ble with an entreprene@@ u@@ ri@@ al society and economy . &quot;
P@@ lan@@ ning is the ki@@ ss of death of entreprene@@ ur@@ ship .
So now you &apos;re re@@ building Christ@@ church without knowing what the smar@@ test people in Christ@@ church want to do with their own money and their own energy .
You have to learn how to get these people to come and talk to you .
You have to offer them confi@@ d@@ enti@@ ality , privacy , you have to be fantastic at helping them , and then they will come , and they will come in dro@@ ves .
In a community of 10,000 people , we get 200 cli@@ ents .
Can you imagine a community of 40@@ 0,000 people , the intelligence and the passion ?
Which presentation have you app@@ lau@@ ded the most this morning ?
Lo@@ cal , passionate people . That &apos;s who you have app@@ lau@@ ded .
So what I &apos;m saying is that entreprene@@ ur@@ ship is where it &apos;s at .
We are at the end of the first industrial revolution -- non@@ r@@ ene@@ w@@ able fossi@@ l fu@@ els , manufacturing -- and all of a sudden , we have systems which are not sustainable .
The internal com@@ bu@@ s@@ tion engine is not sustainable .
Fre@@ on way of main@@ ta@@ ining things is not sustainable .
What we have to look at is at how we feed , cure , educ@@ ate , transp@@ ort , communicate for seven billion people in a sustainable way .
The technologies do not exist to do that .
Who is going to invent the technology for the green revolution ? Uni@@ ver@@ sities ? For@@ get about it !
G@@ over@@ n@@ ment ? For@@ get about it !
It will be entrepreneurs , and they &apos;re doing it now .
There &apos;s a lovely story that I read in a fu@@ tu@@ ri@@ st magazine many , many years ago .
There was a group of experts who were invited to discu@@ ss the future of the city of New York in 18@@ 60 .
And in 18@@ 60 , this group of people came together , and they all spec@@ ul@@ ated about what would happen to the city of New York in 100 years , and the conclusion was un@@ anim@@ ous : The city of New York would not exist in 100 years .
Why ? Because they looked at the curve and said , if the population keeps growing at this rate , to move the population of New York around , they would have needed six million hor@@ ses , and the man@@ ure created by six million hor@@ ses would be impossible to deal with .
They were already dro@@ w@@ ning in man@@ ure .
So 18@@ 60 , they are seeing this dir@@ ty technology that is going to cho@@ ke the life out of New York .
So what happens ? In 40 years &apos; time , in the year 1900 , in the United States of America , there were 1,@@ 00@@ 1 car manufacturing companies -- 1,@@ 00@@ 1 .
The idea of finding a different technology had absolutely taken over , and there were tiny , tiny little fac@@ tories in back@@ wat@@ ers .
D@@ ear@@ born , Mi@@ chi@@ gan . Henry Ford .
However , there is a secret to work with entrepreneurs .
First , you have to offer them confi@@ d@@ enti@@ ality .
O@@ ther@@ wise they don &apos;t come and talk to you .
Then you have to offer them absolute , de@@ dicated , passionate service to them .
And then you have to tell them the truth about entreprene@@ ur@@ ship .
The sm@@ alle@@ st company , the biggest company , has to be capable of doing three things beauti@@ fully : The product that you want to sell has to be fantastic , you have to have fantastic marketing , and you have to have tremendous financial management .
Gu@@ ess what ?
We have never met a single human being in the world who can make it , sell it and look after the money .
It doesn &apos;t exist .
This person has never been born .
We &apos;ve done the research , and we have looked at the 100 i@@ con@@ ic companies of the world -- Car@@ ne@@ gie , W@@ esti@@ ngh@@ ouse , E@@ di@@ son , Ford , all the new companies , Google , Y@@ a@@ ho@@ o .
There &apos;s only one thing that all the successful companies in the world have in common , only one : N@@ one were started by one person .
Now we teach entreprene@@ ur@@ ship to 16@@ -@@ year-olds in Nor@@ thu@@ mb@@ er@@ land , and we start the class by giving them the first two pages of Richard B@@ ran@@ son &apos;s au@@ to@@ bio@@ graphy , and the task of the 16@@ -@@ year-olds is to under@@ line , in the first two pages of Richard B@@ ran@@ son &apos;s au@@ to@@ bio@@ graphy how many times Richard uses the word &quot; I &quot; and how many times he uses the word &quot; we . &quot;
N@@ ever the word &quot; I , &quot; and the word &quot; we &quot; 32 times .
He wasn &apos;t alone when he started .
Nobody started a company alone . No one .
So we can create the community where we have faci@@ lit@@ ators who come from a small business background sitting in ca@@ f@@ es , in bar@@ s , and your de@@ dicated bud@@ dies who will do to you , what somebody did for this gentle@@ man who talks about this e@@ pic , somebody who will say to you , &quot; What do you need ?
What can you do ? Can you make it ?
Okay , can you sell it ? Can you look after the money ? &quot;
&quot; Oh , no , I cannot do this . &quot; &quot; Would you like me to find you somebody ? &quot;
We activ@@ ate communities .
We have groups of volunteers suppor@@ ting the En@@ ter@@ pri@@ se F@@ aci@@ lit@@ ator to help you to find resources and people and we have discovered that the mirac@@ le of the intelligence of local people is such that you can change the culture and the economy of this community just by cap@@ turing the passion , the energy and imagination of your own people .
Thank you .
Before Mar@@ ch , 2011 , I was a photograp@@ hic re@@ tou@@ cher based in New York City .
We &apos;re p@@ ale , gray creatures .
We hide in dark , win@@ dow@@ less rooms , and generally avoid sunlight .
We make sk@@ in@@ ny models sk@@ in@@ ni@@ er , perfect skin more perfect , and the impossible possible , and we get cri@@ tici@@ zed in the press all the time , but some of us are actually tal@@ ented artists with years of experience and a real appreci@@ ation for images and photography .
On Mar@@ ch 11 , 2011 , I watched from home , as the rest of the world did , as the tra@@ gic events un@@ fol@@ ded in Japan .
So@@ on after , an organization I volunte@@ er with , All H@@ ands V@@ ol@@ un@@ te@@ ers , were on the ground , within days , working as part of the response efforts .
I , along with hundreds of other volunteers , knew we couldn &apos;t just sit at home , so I decided to join them for three weeks .
On May the 1@@ 3@@ th , I made my way to the town of Ō@@ fun@@ a@@ to .
It &apos;s a small fishing town in I@@ w@@ ate Pre@@ f@@ ecture , about 50,000 people , one of the first that was hit by the wave .
The wat@@ ers here have been recorded at reaching over 24 meters in height , and traveled over two miles in@@ land .
As you can imagine , the town had been deva@@ st@@ ated .
We pulled de@@ br@@ is from can@@ als and dit@@ ches .
We clean@@ ed schools . We de-@@ mu@@ d@@ ded and gu@@ t@@ ted homes ready for ren@@ o@@ vation and re@@ ha@@ bili@@ tation .
We clear@@ ed tons and tons of stin@@ king , rot@@ ting fish car@@ cas@@ ses from the local fish processing plant .
We got dir@@ ty , and we loved it .
For weeks , all the volunteers and lo@@ cals ali@@ ke had been finding similar things .
They &apos;d been finding photos and photo albu@@ ms and cameras and S@@ D cards .
And everyone was doing the same .
They were collecting them up , and h@@ anding them in to various places around the different to@@ w@@ ns for safe@@ keeping .
Now , it wasn &apos;t until this point that I realized that these photos were such a huge part of the personal loss these people had felt .
As they had run from the wave , and for their lives , absolutely everything they had , everything had to be left behind .
At the end of my first week there , I found myself helping out in an ev@@ acu@@ ation center in the town .
I was helping clean the on@@ sen , the commu@@ nal on@@ sen , the huge giant ba@@ th@@ tu@@ bs .
This happened to also be a place in the town where the ev@@ acu@@ ation center was collecting the photos .
This is where people were h@@ anding them in , and I was hon@@ o@@ red that day that they actually tru@@ sted me to help them start hand@@ -@@ cle@@ aning them .
Now , it was emotional and it was inspiring , and I &apos;ve always heard about thinking outside the box , but it wasn &apos;t until I had actually gotten outside of my box that something happened .
As I looked through the photos , there were some were over a hundred years old , some still in the en@@ velo@@ pe from the processing lab , I couldn &apos;t help but think as a re@@ tou@@ cher that I could fix that t@@ ear and m@@ end that scr@@ atch , and I knew hundreds of people who could do the same .
So that evening , I just reached out on Facebook and asked a few of them , and by morning the response had been so overwhel@@ ming and so positive , I knew we had to give it a go .
So we started re@@ tou@@ ching photos .
This was the very first .
Not terri@@ bly da@@ mag@@ ed , but where the water had caused that dis@@ col@@ or@@ ation on the girl &apos;s face had to be re@@ pa@@ i@@ red with such accur@@ acy and de@@ lic@@ acy .
O@@ ther@@ wise , that little girl isn &apos;t going to look like that little girl anymore , and surely that &apos;s as tra@@ gic as having the photo da@@ mag@@ ed .
Over time , more photos came in , th@@ ank@@ fully , and more re@@ tou@@ chers were needed , and so I reached out again on Facebook and Lin@@ ke@@ d@@ In , and within five days , 80 people wanted to help from 12 different countries .
Wi@@ thin two weeks , I had 150 people wanting to join in .
Wi@@ thin Japan , by Ju@@ ly , we &apos;d bran@@ ched out to the neighbor@@ ing town of Ri@@ k@@ u@@ z@@ en@@ ta@@ k@@ a@@ ta , further north to a town called Y@@ ama@@ da .
Once a week , we would set up our scan@@ ning equipment in the temporary photo libr@@ aries that had been set up , where people were rec@@ la@@ im@@ ing their photos .
The older ladies sometimes hadn &apos;t seen a scan@@ ner before , but within 10 minutes of them finding their lost photo , they could give it to us , have it scan@@ ned , up@@ lo@@ aded to a cloud ser@@ ver , it would be down@@ lo@@ aded by a ga@@ i@@ j@@ in , a str@@ anger , somewhere on the other side of the globe , and it &apos;d start being fixed .
The time it took , however , to get it back is a completely different story , and it dep@@ ended obviously on the damage involved .
It could take an hour . It could take weeks .
It could take months .
The ki@@ mon@@ o in this shot pretty much had to be hand@@ -@@ drawn , or piec@@ ed together , pic@@ king out the rema@@ ining parts of color and detail that the water hadn &apos;t da@@ mag@@ ed .
It was very ti@@ me-@@ consu@@ ming .
Now , all these photos had been da@@ mag@@ ed by water , sub@@ mer@@ ged in sal@@ t water , covered in bacteria , in se@@ w@@ age , sometimes even in oil , all of which over time is going to continue to damage them , so hand@@ -@@ cle@@ aning them was a huge part of the project .
We couldn &apos;t re@@ touch the photo unless it was clean@@ ed , dry and rec@@ la@@ im@@ ed .
Now , we were lucky with our hand@@ -@@ cle@@ aning .
We had an amazing local woman who gui@@ ded us .
It &apos;s very easy to do more damage to those da@@ mag@@ ed photos .
As my team leader W@@ yn@@ ne once said , it &apos;s like doing a tat@@ too on someone .
You don &apos;t get a chance to mess it up .
The lady who brought us these photos was lucky , as far as the photos go .
She had started hand@@ -@@ cle@@ aning them herself and stopped when she realized she was doing more damage .
She also had du@@ p@@ lic@@ ates .
A@@ re@@ as like her husband and her face , which otherwise would have been completely impossible to fix , we could just put them together in one good photo , and re@@ make the whole photo .
When she collected the photos from us , she shared a bit of her story with us .
Her photos were found by her husband &apos;s colleagues at a local fire department in the de@@ br@@ is a long way from where the home had once stood , and they &apos;d recogni@@ zed him .
The day of the t@@ sun@@ ami , he &apos;d actually been in charge of making sure the t@@ sun@@ ami g@@ ates were closed .
He had to go towards the water as the si@@ ren@@ s soun@@ ded .
Her two little boys , not so little anymore , but her two boys were both at school , separate schools .
One of them got caught up in the water .
It took her a week to find them all again and find out that they had all survi@@ ved .
The day I gave her the photos also happened to be her you@@ ng@@ est son &apos;s 14@@ th birthday .
For her , despite all of this , those photos were the perfect gift back to him , something he could look at again , something he rememb@@ ered from before that wasn &apos;t still scar@@ red from that day in Mar@@ ch when absolutely everything else in his life had changed or been destroyed .
After six months in Japan , 1,@@ 100 volunteers had passed through All H@@ ands , hundreds of whom had helped us hand@@ -@@ clean over 1@@ 3@@ 5,000 photographs , the large majority a large majority of which did actually find their home again , importantly .
Over five hundred volunteers around the globe helped us get 90 families hundreds of photographs back , fully re@@ sto@@ red and re@@ touched .
Dur@@ ing this time , we hadn &apos;t really spent more than about a thousand dollars in equipment and materials , most of which was prin@@ ter in@@ ks .
We take photos constantly .
A photo is a remin@@ der of someone or something , a place , a relationship , a loved one .
They &apos;re our memor@@ y-@@ kee@@ pers and our hi@@ stories , the last thing we would grab and the first thing you &apos;d go back to look for .
That &apos;s all this project was about , about re@@ stor@@ ing those little bits of humanity , giving someone that connection back .
When a photo like this can be returned to someone like this , it makes a huge difference in the lives of the person recei@@ ving it .
The project &apos;s also made a big difference in the lives of the re@@ tou@@ chers .
For some of them , it &apos;s given them a connection to something bigger , giving something back , using their tal@@ ents on something other than sk@@ in@@ ny models and perfect skin .
I would like to conclu@@ de by reading an email I got from one of them , C@@ in@@ dy , the day I finally got back from Japan after six months .
&quot; As I worked , I couldn &apos;t help but think about the individuals and the stories represented in the images .
One in particular , a photo of women of all ages , from grandmother to little girl , gather@@ ed around a baby , struck a ch@@ ord , because a similar photo from my family , my grandmother and mother , myself , and new@@ born daughter , hang@@ s on our wall .
A@@ cross the globe , throughout the ages , our basic needs are just the same , aren &apos;t they ? &quot;
Thank you .
I &apos;m 150 feet down an illegal mine sha@@ ft in Ghana .
The air is th@@ ick with heat and du@@ st , and it &apos;s hard to breathe .
I can feel the br@@ ush of swe@@ at@@ y bodies pas@@ sing me in the dar@@ kness , but I can &apos;t see much else .
I hear voices talking , but mostly the sha@@ ft is this cac@@ oph@@ ony of men cou@@ gh@@ ing , and stone being broken with pri@@ mi@@ tive tools .
Like the others , I wear a f@@ lic@@ k@@ ering , cheap fla@@ sh@@ light tied to my head with this el@@ astic , tat@@ tered band , and I can b@@ arely make out the sli@@ ck tree li@@ mb@@ s holding up the walls of the three-@@ foot square hole dro@@ pping hundreds of feet into the earth .
When my hand sli@@ ps , I suddenly remember a min@@ er I had met days before who had lost his gri@@ p and fell coun@@ t@@ less feet down that sha@@ ft .
As I stand talking to you today , these men are still deep in that hole , ris@@ king their lives without pay@@ ment or comp@@ en@@ sation , and often dying .
I got to climb out of that hole , and I got to go home , but they likely never will , because they &apos;re tr@@ apped in sla@@ very .
For the last 28 years , I &apos;ve been docu@@ men@@ ting indi@@ gen@@ ous cultures in more than 70 countries on six contin@@ ents , and in 2009 I had the great honor of being the so@@ le exhi@@ bit@@ or at the V@@ an@@ cou@@ ver Pe@@ ace Su@@ m@@ mit .
A@@ mo@@ ngst all the astonishing people I met there , I met a suppor@@ ter of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves , an NG@@ O de@@ dicated to era@@ di@@ cating modern day sla@@ very .
We started talking about sla@@ very , and really , I started learning about sla@@ very , for I had certainly known it existed in the world , but not to such a degree .
After we finished talking , I felt so horrible and honest@@ ly as@@ ha@@ med at my own lack of knowledge of this a@@ tro@@ city in my own lifetime , and I thought , if I don &apos;t know , how many other people don &apos;t know ?
It started burning a hole in my stom@@ ach , so within weeks , I fle@@ w down to Los Angeles to meet with the director of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves and offer them my help .
Th@@ us began my journey into modern day sla@@ very .
O@@ dd@@ ly , I had been to many of these places before .
Some I even considered like my second home .
But this time , I would see the sk@@ el@@ et@@ ons hidden in the clos@@ et .
A conser@@ vative estimate tells us there are more than 27 million people en@@ sla@@ ved in the world today .
That &apos;s double the amount of people taken from Africa during the entire trans@@ -@@ Atlan@@ tic sla@@ ve trade .
A hundred and fif@@ ty years ago , an agri@@ cultural sla@@ ve cost about three times the an@@ nu@@ al sal@@ ary of an American worker .
That equ@@ ates to about $ 50,000 in today &apos;s money .
Yet today , entire families can be en@@ sla@@ ved for generations over a debt as small as $ 18 .
A@@ st@@ oni@@ shi@@ ngly , sla@@ very gener@@ ates prof@@ its of more than $ 13 billion worldwide each year .
Many have been tr@@ ic@@ ked by false prom@@ ises of a good education , a better job , only to find that they &apos;re forced to work without pay under the threat of violence , and they cannot walk away .
Today &apos;s sla@@ very is about commer@@ ce , so the goods that en@@ sla@@ ved people produce have value , but the people producing them are disp@@ os@@ able .
S@@ la@@ very exists everywhere , nearly , in the world , and yet it is illegal everywhere in the world .
In India and N@@ ep@@ al , I was introduced to the bri@@ ck kil@@ ns .
This strange and awesome sight was like walking into ancient Egypt or Dan@@ te &apos;s In@@ fer@@ no .
En@@ velo@@ ped in temper@@ atures of 1@@ 30 degrees , men , women , children , entire families in fact , were clo@@ a@@ ked in a heavy b@@ lan@@ ket of du@@ st , while mechan@@ ically st@@ acking bri@@ cks on their head , up to 18 at a time , and carrying them from the s@@ cor@@ ching kil@@ ns to tru@@ cks hundreds of y@@ ards away .
D@@ ea@@ den@@ ed by mon@@ ot@@ ony and ex@@ ha@@ us@@ tion , they work sil@@ ently , doing this task over and over for 16 or 17 hours a day .
There were no brea@@ ks for food , no water brea@@ ks , and the severe de@@ hy@@ dra@@ tion made ur@@ in@@ ating pretty much in@@ consequ@@ ential .
So per@@ va@@ sive was the heat and the du@@ st that my camera became too hot to even touch and ce@@ ased working .
Every 20 minutes , I &apos;d have to run back to our cru@@ is@@ er to clean out my g@@ ear and run it under an air condi@@ tion@@ er to re@@ vi@@ ve it , and as I sat there , I thought , my camera is getting far better treatment than these people .
B@@ ack in the kil@@ ns , I wanted to cry , but the abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist next to me quickly gr@@ ab@@ bed me and he said , &quot; L@@ is@@ a , don &apos;t do that . Just don &apos;t do that here . &quot;
And he very clearly explained to me that emotional disp@@ la@@ ys are very dangerous in a place like this , not just for me , but for them .
I couldn &apos;t offer them any direct help .
I couldn &apos;t give them money , nothing .
I wasn &apos;t a citiz@@ en of that country .
I could get them in a worse situation than they were already in .
I &apos;d have to rely on F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves to work within the system for their liber@@ ation , and I tru@@ sted that they would .
As for me , I &apos;d have to wait until I got home to really feel my hear@@ t@@ break .
In the H@@ im@@ ala@@ y@@ as , I found children carrying stone for miles down moun@@ tain@@ ous ter@@ rain to tru@@ cks waiting at roads below .
The big sh@@ eets of s@@ late were hea@@ vi@@ er than the children carrying them , and the kids ho@@ i@@ sted them from their heads using these hand@@ made har@@ ne@@ sses of sticks and ro@@ pe and tor@@ n cl@@ oth .
It &apos;s difficult to wit@@ ness something so overwhel@@ ming .
How can we affect something so insi@@ di@@ ous , yet so per@@ va@@ sive ?
Some don &apos;t even know they &apos;re en@@ sla@@ ved , people working 16 , 17 hours a day without any pay , because this has been the case all their lives .
They have nothing to compare it to .
When these villa@@ gers cla@@ im@@ ed their freedom , the sla@@ ve@@ hol@@ ders bur@@ ned down all of their houses .
I mean , these people had nothing , and they were so pe@@ tri@@ fied , they wanted to give up , but the woman in the center r@@ al@@ lied for them to per@@ severe , and abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ists on the ground helped them get a quar@@ ry lease of their own , so that now they do the same back@@ -@@ breaking work , but they do it for themselves , and they get paid for it , and they do it in freedom .
Se@@ x traffi@@ cking is what we often think of when we hear the word sla@@ very , and because of this worldwide awareness , I was war@@ ned that it would be difficult for me to work safe@@ ly within this particular industry .
In K@@ ath@@ man@@ du , I was es@@ cor@@ ted by women who had previ@@ ously been sex sla@@ ves themselves .
They u@@ sh@@ ered me down a nar@@ row set of sta@@ irs that led to this dir@@ ty , di@@ m@@ ly flu@@ ore@@ s@@ cent lit base@@ ment .
This wasn &apos;t a bro@@ the@@ l , per se .
It was more like a restaurant .
C@@ ab@@ in rest@@ au@@ rants , as they &apos;re known in the trade , are venu@@ es for forced pros@@ titu@@ tion .
Each has small , private rooms , where the sla@@ ves , women , along with young girls and boys , some as young as seven years old , are forced to enter@@ tain the cli@@ ents , encoura@@ ging them to buy more food and al@@ coho@@ l .
Each cu@@ b@@ ic@@ le is dark and di@@ ng@@ y , identi@@ fied with a pain@@ ted number on the wall , and parti@@ tioned by pl@@ y@@ wood and a cur@@ tain .
The workers here often en@@ du@@ re tra@@ gic sexual ab@@ use at the hands of their customers .
St@@ anding in the near dar@@ kness , I remember feeling this quick , hot fear , and in that inst@@ ant , I could only imagine what it must be like to be tr@@ apped in that hell .
I had only one way out : the sta@@ irs from where I &apos;d come in .
There were no back doors .
There were no windows large enough to climb through .
These people have no escap@@ e at all , and as we take in such a difficult subject , it &apos;s important to note that sla@@ very , including sex traffi@@ cking , occur@@ s in our own back@@ yard as well .
T@@ ens of hundreds of people are en@@ sla@@ ved in agriculture , in rest@@ au@@ rants , in dom@@ es@@ tic ser@@ vit@@ u@@ de , and the list can go on .
Rec@@ ently , the New York Times reported that between 100,000 and 30@@ 0,000 American children are sold into sex sla@@ very every year .
It &apos;s all around us . We just don &apos;t see it .
The tex@@ tile industry is another one we often think of when we hear about sla@@ ve labor .
I vis@@ ited villages in India where entire families were en@@ sla@@ ved in the sil@@ k trade .
This is a family portra@@ it .
The d@@ yed black hands are the father , while the blue and red hands are his sons .
They mix dy@@ e in these big bar@@ re@@ ls , and they sub@@ mer@@ ge the sil@@ k into the liquid up to their el@@ bo@@ ws , but the dy@@ e is tox@@ ic .
My interpre@@ ter told me their stories .
&quot; We have no freedom , &quot; they said .
&quot; We hope still , though , that we could leave this house some@@ day and go some@@ place else where we actually get paid for our dy@@ e@@ ing . &quot;
It &apos;s es@@ tim@@ ated that more than 4,000 children are en@@ sla@@ ved on La@@ ke V@@ ol@@ ta , the largest man@@ -@@ made la@@ ke in the world .
When we first arrived , I went to have a quick look .
I saw what seemed to be a family fishing on a boat , two older brothers , some younger kids , makes sense right ?
W@@ r@@ ong . They were all en@@ sla@@ ved .
Children are taken from their families and traffi@@ cked and v@@ ani@@ shed , and they &apos;re forced to work end@@ less hours on these bo@@ ats on the la@@ ke , even though they do not know how to swim .
This young child is eight years old .
He was tre@@ mb@@ ling when our boat approa@@ ched , frighten@@ ed it would run over his tiny can@@ o@@ e .
He was pe@@ tri@@ fied he would be kno@@ cked in the water .
The sk@@ ele@@ tal tree li@@ mb@@ s sub@@ mer@@ ged in La@@ ke V@@ ol@@ ta often catch the fishing nets , and wear@@ y , frighten@@ ed children are thrown into the water to un@@ te@@ ther the lines .
Many of them dro@@ wn .
For as long as he can rec@@ all , he &apos;s been forced to work on the la@@ ke .
Ter@@ ri@@ fied of his master , he will not run away , and since he &apos;s been treated with cru@@ el@@ ty all his life , he pas@@ ses that down to the younger sla@@ ves that he man@@ ages .
I met these boys at five in the morning , when they were ha@@ u@@ ling in the last of their nets , but they had been working since 1 a@@ .m.
in the cold , win@@ dy night .
And it &apos;s important to note that these nets we@@ i@@ gh more than a thousand pounds when they &apos;re full of fish .
I want to introduce you to K@@ of@@ i .
K@@ of@@ i was rescu@@ ed from a fishing village .
I met him at a shel@@ ter where F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves re@@ ha@@ bi@@ lit@@ ates victims of sla@@ very .
Here he &apos;s seen taking a b@@ ath at the well , p@@ our@@ ing big bu@@ ckets of water over his head , and the wonderful news is , as you and I are sitting here talking today , K@@ of@@ i has been re@@ un@@ ited with his family , and what &apos;s even better , his family has been given tools to make a living and to keep their children safe .
K@@ of@@ i is the em@@ bo@@ di@@ ment of possibility .
Who will he become because someone took a stand and made a difference in his life ?
D@@ ri@@ ving down a road in Ghana with partners of F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves , a fellow abo@@ li@@ tion@@ ist on a m@@ op@@ ed suddenly sp@@ ed up to our cru@@ is@@ er and t@@ apped on the window .
He told us to follow him down a dir@@ t road into the ju@@ ng@@ le .
At the end of the road , he ur@@ ged us out of the car , and told the driver to quickly leave .
Then he pointed toward this b@@ arely visible foot@@ path , and said , &quot; This is the path , this is the path . Go . &quot;
As we started down the path , we pu@@ shed a@@ side the v@@ ines blo@@ cking the way , and after about an hour of walking in , found that the tra@@ il had become floo@@ ded by recent ra@@ ins , so I ho@@ i@@ sted the photo g@@ ear above my head as we des@@ cen@@ ded into these wat@@ ers up to my chest .
After another two hours of hi@@ king , the win@@ ding tra@@ il ab@@ rup@@ tly ended at a clear@@ ing , and before us was a mass of holes that could fit into the size of a foot@@ ball field , and all of them were full of en@@ sla@@ ved people labor@@ ing .
Many women had children str@@ apped to their b@@ acks while they were pan@@ ning for gold , w@@ ading in water po@@ is@@ oned by mer@@ cu@@ ry .
Mer@@ cu@@ ry is used in the ex@@ tr@@ action process .
These min@@ ers are en@@ sla@@ ved in a mine sha@@ ft in another part of Ghana .
When they came out of the sha@@ ft , they were so@@ a@@ king w@@ et from their own swe@@ at .
I remember looking into their ti@@ red , bloo@@ d@@ shot eyes , for many of them had been underground for 72 hours .
The sha@@ f@@ ts are up to 300 feet deep , and they carry out heavy b@@ ags of stone that later will be transpor@@ ted to another area , where the stone will be p@@ oun@@ ded so that they can extract the gold .
At first gl@@ ance , the p@@ oun@@ ding site seems full of powerful men , but when we look closer , we see some less fortunate working on the fri@@ ng@@ es , and children too .
All of them are vic@@ tim to injury , illness and violence .
In fact , it &apos;s very likely that this mu@@ s@@ cular person will end up like this one here , rac@@ ked with tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is and mer@@ cu@@ ry po@@ is@@ on@@ ing in just a few years .
This is Man@@ ur@@ u . When his father died , his un@@ cle traffi@@ cked him to work with him in the mines .
When his un@@ cle died , Man@@ ur@@ u inher@@ ited his un@@ cle &apos;s debt , which further forced him into being en@@ sla@@ ved in the mines .
When I met him , he had been working in the mines for 14 years , and the leg injury that you see here is actually from a mining accident , one so severe doctors say his leg should be amp@@ ut@@ ated .
On top of that , Man@@ ur@@ u has tu@@ ber@@ cul@@ os@@ is , yet he &apos;s still forced to work day in and day out in that mine sha@@ ft .
Even still , he has a dream that he will become free and become educ@@ ated with the help of local activi@@ sts like F@@ ree the S@@ la@@ ves , and it &apos;s this sort of determin@@ ation , in the face of un@@ imag@@ in@@ able od@@ ds , that fil@@ ls me with complete a@@ we .
I want to shine a light on sla@@ very .
When I was working in the field , I brought lots of c@@ and@@ les with me , and with the help of my interpre@@ ter , I imp@@ ar@@ ted to the people I was photograph@@ ing that I wanted to illu@@ min@@ ate their stories and their p@@ light , so when it was safe for them , and safe for me , I made these images .
They knew their image would be seen by you out in the world .
I wanted them to know that we will be be@@ ar@@ ing wit@@ ness to them , and that we will do whatever we can to help make a difference in their lives .
I truly believe , if we can see one another as fellow human beings , then it becomes very difficult to toler@@ ate a@@ tro@@ cities like sla@@ very .
These images are not of issues . They are of people , real people , like you and me , all deser@@ ving of the same rights , dig@@ nity and respect in their lives .
There is not a day that goes by that I don &apos;t think of these many beautiful , mi@@ str@@ e@@ ated people I &apos;ve had the tremendous honor of meeting .
I hope that these images a@@ wa@@ ken a force in those who view them , people like you , and I hope that force will ign@@ ite a fire , and that fire will shine a light on sla@@ very , for without that light , the be@@ ast of bon@@ d@@ age can continue to live in the sha@@ dows .
Thank you very much .
