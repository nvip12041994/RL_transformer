How can I speak in 10 minutes about the bon@@ ds of women over three generations , about how the astonishing strength of those bon@@ ds took hold in the life of a four@@ -year-old girl hu@@ dd@@ led with her young sister , her mother and her grandmother for five days and ni@@ ghts in a small boat in the China Se@@ a more than 30 years ago , bon@@ ds that took hold in the life of that small girl and never let go -- that small girl now living in San Francisco and speaking to you today ?
This is not a finished story .
It is a j@@ ig@@ saw puzzle still being put together .
Let me tell you about some of the pieces .
Imagine the first piece : a man burning his life &apos;s work .
He is a po@@ et , a play@@ w@@ right , a man whose whole life had been bal@@ anced on the single hope of his country &apos;s un@@ ity and freedom .
Imagine him as the communi@@ sts enter Sa@@ ig@@ on , con@@ fron@@ ting the fact that his life had been a complete waste .
Wor@@ ds , for so long his friends , now mo@@ cked him .
He re@@ treated into silence .
He died broken by history .
He is my grandfather .
I never knew him in real life .
But our lives are much more than our memories .
My grandmother never let me forget his life .
My du@@ ty was not to allow it to have been in va@@ in , and my lesson was to learn that , yes , history tried to cr@@ ush us , but we en@@ du@@ red .
The next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is of a boat in the early da@@ wn sli@@ pping sil@@ ently out to sea .
My mother , M@@ ai , was 18 when her father died -- already in an ar@@ ran@@ ged marriage , already with two small girls .
For her , life had di@@ sti@@ l@@ led itself into one task : the escap@@ e of her family and a new life in Australia .
It was in@@ con@@ cei@@ vable to her that she would not succeed .
So after a four-@@ year sa@@ ga that de@@ fi@@ es fiction , a boat sli@@ pped out to sea dis@@ gu@@ is@@ ed as a fishing ves@@ sel .
All the adults knew the risks .
The greatest fear was of p@@ ir@@ ates , rap@@ e and death .
Like most adults on the boat , my mother carried a small bottle of po@@ ison .
If we were captured , first my sister and I , then she and my grandmother would drink .
My first memories are from the boat -- the stea@@ dy beat of the engine , the bow di@@ pping into each wave , the vast and empty hori@@ zon .
I don &apos;t remember the p@@ ir@@ ates who came many times , but were blu@@ ff@@ ed by the bra@@ va@@ do of the men on our boat , or the engine dying and failing to start for six hours .
But I do remember the lights on the oil ri@@ g off the M@@ ala@@ ysi@@ an coast and the young man who collap@@ sed and died , the journey &apos;s end too much for him , and the first apple I ta@@ sted , given to me by the men on the ri@@ g .
No apple has ever ta@@ sted the same .
After three months in a refuge@@ e camp , we lan@@ ded in Mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
And the next piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw is about four women across three generations shap@@ ing a new life together .
We set@@ tled in Fo@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay , a wor@@ ki@@ ng-@@ class su@@ bur@@ b whose demo@@ graphic is la@@ yers of im@@ migr@@ ants .
Un@@ like the set@@ tled mi@@ dd@@ le-@@ class su@@ bur@@ bs , whose existence I was ob@@ li@@ vi@@ ous of , there was no sense of enti@@ tle@@ ment in Fo@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay .
The sm@@ ells from shop doors were from the rest of the world .
And the s@@ ni@@ p@@ pe@@ ts of hal@@ ting English were ex@@ changed between people who had one thing in common , they were starting again .
My mother worked on far@@ ms , then on a car assemb@@ ly line , working six days , double shif@@ ts .
Some@@ how she found time to study English and gain IT qu@@ ali@@ fi@@ cations .
We were poor .
All the dollars were allo@@ c@@ ated and extra tu@@ ition in English and mathematics was bud@@ ge@@ ted for regar@@ dless of what missed out , which was usually new clothes ; they were always secon@@ d@@ hand .
Two pa@@ irs of sto@@ cki@@ ngs for school , each to hide the holes in the other .
A school uni@@ form down to the ank@@ les , because it had to last for six years .
And there were rare but sear@@ ing chan@@ ts of &quot; s@@ lit@@ -@@ eye &quot; and the occa@@ sional gra@@ ff@@ iti : &quot; A@@ sian , go home . &quot;
Go home to where ?
Some@@ thing sti@@ ff@@ ened inside me .
There was a gather@@ ing of re@@ solve and a quiet voice saying , &quot; I will by@@ pass you . &quot;
My mother , my sister and I sle@@ pt in the same bed .
My mother was ex@@ ha@@ u@@ sted each night , but we told one another about our day and list@@ ened to the movements of my grandmother around the house .
My mother suffer@@ ed from ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es all about the boat .
And my job was to stay a@@ wake until her ni@@ ght@@ mar@@ es came so I could wake her .
She opened a computer store then studied to be a beauti@@ cian and opened another business .
And the women came with their stories about men who could not make the transition , angry and inf@@ le@@ xi@@ ble , and trou@@ b@@ led children caught between two worlds .
G@@ rants and spon@@ s@@ ors were s@@ ought .
Cen@@ ters were estab@@ lished .
I lived in par@@ alle@@ l worlds .
In one , I was the classic A@@ sian student , re@@ len@@ t@@ less in the deman@@ ds that I made on myself .
In the other , I was en@@ mes@@ h@@ ed in lives that were pre@@ car@@ i@@ ous , tra@@ gi@@ cally scar@@ red by violence , drug ab@@ use and iso@@ lation .
But so many over the years were helped .
And for that work , when I was a final year law student , I was chosen as the young Austr@@ ali@@ an of the year .
And I was cat@@ ap@@ ul@@ ted from one piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw to another , and their ed@@ ges didn &apos;t fit .
T@@ an L@@ e , anony@@ mous Fo@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay resident , was now T@@ an L@@ e , refuge@@ e and social activi@@ st , invited to speak in venu@@ es she had never heard of and into homes whose existence she could never have imagined .
I didn &apos;t know the prot@@ o@@ col@@ s .
I didn &apos;t know how to use the cu@@ t@@ l@@ ery .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about wine .
I didn &apos;t know how to talk about anything .
I wanted to re@@ treat to the rou@@ tin@@ es and comfort of life in an un@@ sung su@@ bur@@ b -- a grandmother , a mother and two dau@@ ghters ending each day as they had for almost 20 years , telling one another the story of their day and falling as@@ leep , the three of us still in the same bed .
I told my mother I couldn &apos;t do it .
She remin@@ ded me that I was now the same age she had been when we bo@@ ar@@ ded the boat .
No had never been an option .
&quot; Just do it , &quot; she said , &quot; and don &apos;t be what you &apos;re not . &quot;
So I spoke out on you@@ th une@@ mp@@ loy@@ ment and education and the ne@@ gl@@ ect of the mar@@ gin@@ alized and the dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ is@@ ed .
And the more candi@@ dly I spoke , the more I was asked to speak .
I met people from all walks of life , so many of them doing the thing they loved , living on the fron@@ ti@@ ers of possibility .
And even though I finished my degree , I realized I could not set@@ tle into a career in law .
There had to be another piece of the j@@ ig@@ saw .
And I realized at the same time that it is okay to be an out@@ si@@ der , a recent arri@@ val , new on the scene -- and not just okay , but something to be th@@ ank@@ ful for , perhaps a gift from the boat .
Because being an insi@@ der can so easily mean collap@@ sing the hori@@ z@@ ons , can so easily mean accep@@ ting the pre@@ su@@ mp@@ tions of your pro@@ vin@@ ce .
I have ste@@ pped outside my comfort zone enough now to know that , yes , the world does fall apart , but not in the way that you fear .
P@@ os@@ sibilities that would not have been allowed were ou@@ tra@@ ge@@ ously encoura@@ ged .
There was an energy there , an imp@@ l@@ ac@@ able opti@@ mism , a strange mix@@ ture of hu@@ mi@@ lity and dar@@ ing .
So I followed my hun@@ ches .
I gather@@ ed around me a small team of people for whom the lab@@ el &quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was an ir@@ resi@@ sti@@ ble challenge .
For a year we were pen@@ ni@@ less .
At the end of each day , I made a huge po@@ t of sou@@ p which we all shared .
We worked well into each night .
Most of our ideas were crazy , but a few were brilliant , and we broke through .
I made the decision to move to the U.S.
after only one trip .
My hun@@ ches again .
Three months later I had re@@ loc@@ ated , and the ad@@ venture has continued .
Before I close though , let me tell you about my grandmother .
She grew up at a time when Con@@ fu@@ ci@@ an@@ ism was the social nor@@ m and the local Mand@@ ar@@ in was the person who mat@@ tered .
Life hadn &apos;t changed for centuries .
Her father died soon after she was born .
Her mother raised her alone .
At 17 she became the second wife of a Mand@@ ar@@ in whose mother beat her .
With no support from her husband , she caused a sen@@ sation by taking him to cour@@ t and pros@@ ecu@@ ting her own case , and a far greater sen@@ sation when she won .
&quot; It can &apos;t be done &quot; was shown to be wrong .
I was taking a sho@@ wer in a hotel room in Sy@@ d@@ ney the moment she died 600 miles away in Mel@@ b@@ our@@ ne .
I looked through the sho@@ wer screen and saw her standing on the other side .
I knew she had come to say go@@ od@@ by@@ e .
My mother ph@@ oned minutes later .
A few days later , we went to a Budd@@ hi@@ st temp@@ le in Fo@@ ot@@ scr@@ ay and sat around her cas@@ ket .
We told her stories and assu@@ red her that we were still with her .
At mid@@ night the mon@@ k came and told us he had to close the cas@@ ket .
My mother asked us to feel her hand .
She asked the mon@@ k , &quot; Why is it that her hand is so warm and the rest of her is so cold ? &quot;
&quot; Because you have been holding it since this morning , &quot; he said .
&quot; You have not let it go . &quot;
If there is a sin@@ ew in our family , it runs through the women .
Gi@@ ven who we were and how life had shaped us , we can now see that the men who might have come into our lives would have th@@ war@@ ted us .
De@@ fe@@ at would have come too easily .
Now I would like to have my own children , and I wonder about the boat .
Who could ever wish it on their own ?
Yet I am afraid of privi@@ lege , of ea@@ se , of enti@@ tle@@ ment .
Can I give them a bow in their lives , di@@ pping bra@@ vely into each wave , the un@@ per@@ tur@@ bed and stea@@ dy beat of the engine , the vast hori@@ zon that guaran@@ te@@ es nothing ?
I don &apos;t know .
But if I could give it and still see them safe@@ ly through , I would .
And also , T@@ an &apos;s mother is here today in the fourth or fifth row .
Well this is a really extraordinary honor for me .
I spend most of my time in ja@@ ils , in pri@@ sons , on death row .
I spend most of my time in very low-@@ income communities in the projects and places where there &apos;s a great deal of ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ness .
And being here at TED and seeing the sti@@ mulation , hearing it , has been very , very ener@@ gi@@ zing to me .
And one of the things that &apos;s emer@@ ged in my short time here is that TED has an identity .
And you can actually say things here that have imp@@ acts around the world .
And sometimes when it comes through TED , it has meaning and power that it doesn &apos;t have when it doesn &apos;t .
And I mention that because I think identity is really important .
And we &apos;ve had some fantastic presen@@ tations .
And I think what we &apos;ve learned is that , if you &apos;re a teacher your words can be meaningful , but if you &apos;re a compas@@ sionate teacher , they can be especially meaningful .
If you &apos;re a doctor you can do some good things , but if you &apos;re a car@@ ing doctor you can do some other things .
And so I want to talk about the power of identity .
And I didn &apos;t learn about this actually prac@@ tic@@ ing law and doing the work that I do .
I actually learned about this from my grandmother .
I grew up in a house that was the traditional Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American home that was domin@@ ated by a ma@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch , and that ma@@ tri@@ ar@@ ch was my grandmother .
She was tough , she was strong , she was powerful .
She was the end of every argument in our family .
She was the beginning of a lot of arguments in our family .
She was the daughter of people who were actually en@@ sla@@ ved .
Her parents were born in sla@@ very in Virginia in the 18@@ 40 &apos;s .
She was born in the 18@@ 80 &apos;s and the experience of sla@@ very very much shaped the way she saw the world .
And my grandmother was tough , but she was also lo@@ ving .
When I would see her as a little boy , she &apos;d come up to me and she &apos;d give me these hu@@ gs .
And she &apos;d squ@@ ee@@ ze me so ti@@ ght I could b@@ arely breathe and then she &apos;d let me go .
And an hour or two later , if I saw her , she &apos;d come over to me and she &apos;d say , &quot; Br@@ yan , do you still feel me hu@@ gging you ? &quot;
And if I said , &quot; No , &quot; she &apos;d as@@ sa@@ ul@@ t me again , and if I said , &quot; Yes , &quot; she &apos;d leave me alone .
And she just had this quality that you always wanted to be near her .
And the only challenge was that she had 10 children .
My mom was the you@@ ng@@ est of her 10 kids .
And sometimes when I would go and spend time with her , it would be difficult to get her time and attention .
My cou@@ s@@ ins would be running around everywhere .
And I remember , when I was about eight or nine years old , wa@@ king up one morning , going into the living room , and all of my cou@@ s@@ ins were running around .
And my grandmother was sitting across the room star@@ ing at me .
And at first I thought we were playing a game .
And I would look at her and I &apos;d smile , but she was very serious .
And after about 15 or 20 minutes of this , she got up and she came across the room and she took me by the hand and she said , &quot; Come on , Br@@ yan . You and I are going to have a talk . &quot;
And I remember this just like it happened yesterday .
I never will forget it .
She took me out back and she said , &quot; Br@@ yan , I &apos;m going to tell you something , but you don &apos;t tell anybody what I tell you . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , M@@ ama . &quot;
She said , &quot; Now you make sure you don &apos;t do that . &quot; I said , &quot; S@@ ure . &quot;
Then she sat me down and she looked at me and she said , &quot; I want you to know I &apos;ve been watching you . &quot;
And she said , &quot; I think you &apos;re special . &quot;
She said , &quot; I think you can do anything you want to do . &quot;
I will never forget it .
And then she said , &quot; I just need you to promise me three things , Br@@ yan . &quot;
I said , &quot; Okay , M@@ ama . &quot;
She said , &quot; The first thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always love your mom . &quot;
She said , &quot; That &apos;s my baby girl , and you have to promise me now you &apos;ll always take care of her . &quot;
Well I ado@@ red my mom , so I said , &quot; Yes , M@@ ama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Then she said , &quot; The second thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll always do the right thing even when the right thing is the hard thing . &quot;
And I thought about it and I said , &quot; Yes , M@@ ama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
Then finally she said , &quot; The third thing I want you to promise me is that you &apos;ll never drink al@@ coho@@ l . &quot;
Well I was nine years old , so I said , &quot; Yes , M@@ ama . I &apos;ll do that . &quot;
I grew up in the country in the rural South , and I have a brother a year older than me and a sister a year younger .
When I was about 14 or 15 , one day my brother came home and he had this six@@ -@@ pack of be@@ er -- I don &apos;t know where he got it -- and he gr@@ ab@@ bed me and my sister and we went out in the woo@@ ds .
And we were kind of just out there doing the stuff we cra@@ z@@ ily did .
And he had a si@@ p of this be@@ er and he gave some to my sister and she had some , and they offered it to me .
I said , &quot; No , no , no . That &apos;s okay . You all go ahead . I &apos;m not going to have any be@@ er . &quot;
My brother said , &quot; Come on . We &apos;re doing this today ; you always do what we do .
I had some , your sister had some . Have some be@@ er . &quot;
I said , &quot; No , I don &apos;t feel right about that . Y &apos;@@ all go ahead . Y &apos;@@ all go ahead . &quot;
And then my brother started star@@ ing at me .
He said , &quot; What &apos;s wrong with you ? Have some be@@ er . &quot;
Then he looked at me real hard and he said , &quot; Oh , I hope you &apos;re not still hung up on that conversation M@@ ama had with you . &quot;
I said , &quot; Well , what are you talking about ? &quot;
He said , &quot; Oh , M@@ ama tells all the grand@@ kids that they &apos;re special . &quot;
I was deva@@ st@@ ated .
And I &apos;m going to admit something to you .
I &apos;m going to tell you something I probably shouldn &apos;t .
I know this might be broad@@ cast broad@@ ly .
But I &apos;m 5@@ 2 years old , and I &apos;m going to admit to you that I &apos;ve never had a drop of al@@ coho@@ l .
I don &apos;t say that because I think that &apos;s virtu@@ ous ; I say that because there is power in identity .
When we create the right kind of identity , we can say things to the world around us that they don &apos;t actually believe makes sense .
We can get them to do things that they don &apos;t think they can do .
When I thought about my grandmother , of course she would think all her grand@@ kids were special .
My grandfather was in prison during pro@@ hi@@ bi@@ tion .
My male un@@ cles died of al@@ coho@@ l-@@ related diseases .
And these were the things she thought we needed to comm@@ it to .
Well I &apos;ve been trying to say something about our criminal justice system .
This country is very different today than it was 40 years ago .
In 197@@ 2 , there were 30@@ 0,000 people in ja@@ ils and pri@@ sons .
Today , there are 2.@@ 3 million .
The United States now has the highest rate of in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in the world .
We have seven million people on pro@@ ba@@ tion and par@@ ole .
And mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation , in my judg@@ ment , has fundamentally changed our world .
In poor communities , in communities of color there is this desp@@ air , there is this ho@@ pel@@ ess@@ ness , that is being shaped by these outcomes .
One out of three black men between the ages of 18 and 30 is in jail , in prison , on pro@@ ba@@ tion or par@@ ole .
In urban communities across this country -- Los Angeles , Phil@@ ad@@ el@@ phia , Bal@@ ti@@ more , Washington -- 50 to 60 percent of all young men of color are in jail or prison or on pro@@ ba@@ tion or par@@ ole .
Our system isn &apos;t just being shaped in these ways that seem to be di@@ stor@@ ting around race , they &apos;re also di@@ stor@@ ted by poverty .
We have a system of justice in this country that tre@@ ats you much better if you &apos;re rich and gu@@ il@@ ty than if you &apos;re poor and inno@@ cent .
We@@ al@@ th , not cul@@ p@@ ability , shapes outcomes .
And yet , we seem to be very comfortable .
The politics of fear and anger have made us believe that these are problems that are not our problems .
We &apos;ve been dis@@ connected .
It &apos;s interesting to me .
We &apos;re looking at some very interesting develop@@ ments in our work .
My state of Al@@ ab@@ ama , like a number of states , actually perman@@ ently dis@@ en@@ fran@@ ch@@ ises you if you have a criminal con@@ vi@@ ction .
Right now in Al@@ ab@@ ama 34 percent of the black male population has perman@@ ently lost the right to vote .
We &apos;re actually pro@@ j@@ ecting in another 10 years the level of dis@@ en@@ fran@@ chi@@ se@@ ment will be as high as it &apos;s been since pri@@ or to the pas@@ sage of the Vo@@ ting Ri@@ ghts Act .
And there is this stun@@ ning silence .
I represent children .
A lot of my cli@@ ents are very young .
The United States is the only country in the world where we sentence 1@@ 3@@ -year-old children to die in prison .
We have life imp@@ ri@@ son@@ ment without par@@ ole for kids in this country .
And we &apos;re actually doing some li@@ ti@@ gation .
The only country in the world .
I represent people on death row .
It &apos;s interesting , this question of the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
In many ways , we &apos;ve been taught to think that the real question is , do people de@@ serve to die for the cri@@ mes they &apos;ve commit@@ ted ?
And that &apos;s a very sen@@ sible question .
But there &apos;s another way of thinking about where we are in our identity .
The other way of thinking about it is not , do people de@@ serve to die for the cri@@ mes they comm@@ it , but do we de@@ serve to kill ?
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
De@@ ath pen@@ al@@ ty in America is defined by error .
For every nine people who have been execu@@ ted , we &apos;ve actually identi@@ fied one inno@@ cent person who &apos;s been ex@@ on@@ er@@ ated and released from death row .
A kind of astonishing error rate -- one out of nine people inno@@ cent .
I mean , it &apos;s fascinating .
In a@@ vi@@ ation , we would never let people fly on air@@ planes if for every nine planes that took off one would cr@@ ash .
But somehow we can insul@@ ate ourselves from this problem .
It &apos;s not our problem .
It &apos;s not our bur@@ den .
It &apos;s not our struggle .
I talk a lot about these issues .
I talk about race and this question of whether we de@@ serve to kill .
And it &apos;s interesting , when I teach my students about Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American history , I tell them about sla@@ very .
I tell them about terr@@ or@@ ism , the era that began at the end of re@@ construction that went on to World War II .
We don &apos;t really know very much about it .
But for Afri@@ can@@ -@@ Americans in this country , that was an era defined by ter@@ ror .
In many communities , people had to worry about being ly@@ n@@ ched .
They had to worry about being bom@@ bed .
It was the threat of ter@@ ror that shaped their lives .
And these older people come up to me now and they say , &quot; Mr. Ste@@ ven@@ son , you give talks , you make spee@@ ches , you tell people to stop saying we &apos;re dealing with terr@@ or@@ ism for the first time in our nation &apos;s history after 9 / 11 . &quot;
They tell me to say , &quot; No , tell them that we grew up with that . &quot;
And that era of terr@@ or@@ ism , of course , was followed by se@@ gre@@ gation and decades of rac@@ ial su@@ bor@@ din@@ ation and ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id .
And yet , we have in this country this dynamic where we really don &apos;t like to talk about our problems .
We don &apos;t like to talk about our history .
And because of that , we really haven &apos;t understood what it &apos;s meant to do the things we &apos;ve done histor@@ ically .
We &apos;re constantly running into each other .
We &apos;re constantly creating ten@@ sions and conflicts .
We have a hard time talking about race , and I believe it &apos;s because we are un@@ willing to comm@@ it ourselves to a process of truth and recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
In South Africa , people understood that we couldn &apos;t over@@ come ap@@ ar@@ the@@ id without a commitment to truth and recon@@ ci@@ li@@ ation .
In Rwanda , even after the gen@@ o@@ cide , there was this commitment , but in this country we haven &apos;t done that .
I was giving some lec@@ tures in Germany about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
It was fascinating because one of the s@@ chol@@ ars stood up after the presentation and said , &quot; Well you know it &apos;s deeply trou@@ b@@ ling to hear what you &apos;re talking about . &quot;
He said , &quot; We don &apos;t have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in Germany .
And of course , we can never have the death pen@@ al@@ ty in Germany . &quot;
And the room got very quiet , and this woman said , &quot; There &apos;s no way , with our history , we could ever engage in the systema@@ tic killing of human beings .
It would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able for us to , in an inten@@ tional and deli@@ ber@@ ate way , set about execu@@ ting people . &quot;
And I thought about that .
What would it feel like to be living in a world where the nation state of Germany was execu@@ ting people , especially if they were dis@@ propor@@ tion@@ ately Je@@ wish ?
I couldn &apos;t bear it .
It would be un@@ consci@@ on@@ able .
And yet , in this country , in the states of the O@@ ld South , we execu@@ te people -- where you &apos;re 11 times more likely to get the death pen@@ al@@ ty if the vic@@ tim is white than if the vic@@ tim is black , 22 times more likely to get it if the def@@ end@@ ant is black and the vic@@ tim is white -- in the very states where there are bu@@ ried in the ground the bodies of people who were ly@@ n@@ ched .
And yet , there is this dis@@ connect .
Well I believe that our identity is at risk .
That when we actually don &apos;t care about these difficult things , the positive and wonderful things are non@@ e@@ the@@ less imp@@ licated .
We love innovation .
We love technology . We love creativity .
We love entertainment .
But ultimately , those reali@@ ties are sha@@ do@@ wed by suffering , ab@@ use , de@@ gra@@ dation , mar@@ gin@@ alization .
And for me , it becomes necessary to integr@@ ate the two .
Because ultimately we are talking about a need to be more hope@@ ful , more commit@@ ted , more de@@ dicated to the basic challenges of living in a complex world .
And for me that means spending time thinking and talking about the poor , the disa@@ d@@ v@@ ant@@ aged , those who will never get to TED .
But thinking about them in a way that is integr@@ ated in our own lives .
You know ultimately , we all have to believe things we haven &apos;t seen .
We do . As rational as we are , as commit@@ ted to intel@@ l@@ ect as we are .
In@@ no@@ vation , creativity , development comes not from the ideas in our mind alone .
They come from the ideas in our mind that are also fu@@ eled by some con@@ vi@@ ction in our heart .
And it &apos;s that mind-@@ heart connection that I believe comp@@ els us to not just be att@@ enti@@ ve to all the bright and da@@ zz@@ ly things , but also the dark and difficult things .
V@@ ac@@ la@@ v Ha@@ vel , the great C@@ z@@ ech leader , talked about this .
He said , &quot; When we were in Eastern Europe and dealing with op@@ pression , we wanted all kinds of things , but mostly what we needed was hope , an ori@@ en@@ tation of the spirit , a w@@ illi@@ ng@@ ness to sometimes be in ho@@ pel@@ ess places and be a wit@@ ness . &quot;
Well that ori@@ en@@ tation of the spirit is very much at the core of what I believe even TED communities have to be engaged in .
There is no dis@@ connect around technology and design that will allow us to be fully human until we pay attention to suffering , to poverty , to ex@@ clu@@ sion , to un@@ fair@@ ness , to in@@ justice .
Now I will war@@ n you that this kind of identity is a much more challenging identity than ones that don &apos;t pay attention to this .
It will get to you .
I had the great privi@@ lege , when I was a young law@@ yer , of meeting Ros@@ a Par@@ ks .
And M@@ s@@ . Par@@ ks used to come back to Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery every now and then , and she would get together with two of her de@@ ar@@ est friends , these older women , John@@ nie Car@@ r who was the organi@@ zer of the Mon@@ t@@ g@@ om@@ ery bus bo@@ y@@ cot@@ t -- amazing Afri@@ can@@ -@@ American woman -- and Virginia Dur@@ r , a white woman , whose husband , C@@ lif@@ ford Dur@@ r , represented Dr. King .
And these women would get together and just talk .
And every now and then M@@ s@@ . Car@@ r would call me , and she &apos;d say , &quot; Br@@ yan , M@@ s@@ . Par@@ ks is coming to town . We &apos;re going to get together and talk .
Do you want to come over and listen ? &quot;
And I &apos;d say , &quot; Yes , M@@ a &apos;@@ am , I do . &quot;
And she &apos;d say , &quot; Well what are you going to do when you get here ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m going to listen . &quot;
And I &apos;d go over there and I would , I would just listen .
It would be so ener@@ gi@@ zing and so empo@@ wering .
And one time I was over there listening to these women talk , and after a couple of hours M@@ s@@ . Par@@ ks turned to me and she said , &quot; Now Br@@ yan , tell me what the E@@ qu@@ al Ju@@ sti@@ ce I@@ ni@@ ti@@ ative is .
T@@ ell me what you &apos;re trying to do . &quot;
And I began giving her my rap .
I said , &quot; Well we &apos;re trying to challenge in@@ justice .
We &apos;re trying to help people who have been w@@ ro@@ ngly con@@ vic@@ ted .
We &apos;re trying to con@@ front bias and dis@@ crimin@@ ation in the admini@@ str@@ ation of criminal justice .
We &apos;re trying to end life without par@@ ole senten@@ ces for children .
We &apos;re trying to do something about the death pen@@ al@@ ty .
We &apos;re trying to reduce the prison population .
We &apos;re trying to end mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation . &quot;
I gave her my whole rap , and when I finished she looked at me and she said , &quot; M@@ mm m@@ mm m@@ mm . &quot;
She said , &quot; That &apos;s going to make you ti@@ red , ti@@ red , ti@@ red . &quot;
And that &apos;s when M@@ s@@ . Car@@ r le@@ an@@ ed forward , she put her fi@@ nger in my face , she said , &quot; That &apos;s why you &apos;ve got to be bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve , bra@@ ve . &quot;
And I actually believe that the TED community needs to be more coura@@ geous .
We need to find ways to embrace these challenges , these problems , the suffering .
Because ultimately , our humanity depends on everyone &apos;s humanity .
I &apos;ve learned very simple things doing the work that I do .
It &apos;s just taught me very simple things .
I &apos;ve come to understand and to believe that each of us is more than the worst thing we &apos;ve ever done .
I believe that for every person on the planet .
I think if somebody tells a lie , they &apos;re not just a liar .
I think if somebody takes something that doesn &apos;t bel@@ ong to them , they &apos;re not just a thi@@ ef .
I think even if you kill someone , you &apos;re not just a kil@@ ler .
And because of that there &apos;s this basic human dig@@ nity that must be resp@@ ected by law .
I also believe that in many parts of this country , and certainly in many parts of this globe , that the opposite of poverty is not wealth .
I don &apos;t believe that .
I actually think , in too many places , the opposite of poverty is justice .
And finally , I believe that , despite the fact that it is so dramatic and so beautiful and so inspiring and so sti@@ mu@@ lating , we will ultimately not be jud@@ ged by our technology , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our design , we won &apos;t be jud@@ ged by our intel@@ l@@ ect and reason .
U@@ l@@ timately , you judge the character of a society , not by how they treat their rich and the powerful and the privi@@ leg@@ ed , but by how they treat the poor , the con@@ dem@@ ned , the in@@ car@@ cer@@ ated .
Because it &apos;s in that nex@@ us that we actually begin to understand truly profound things about who we are .
I sometimes get out of balance . I &apos;ll end with this story .
I sometimes push too hard .
I do get ti@@ red , as we all do .
Sometimes those ideas get ahead of our thinking in ways that are important .
And I &apos;ve been represen@@ ting these kids who have been senten@@ ced to do these very har@@ sh senten@@ ces .
And I go to the jail and I see my cli@@ ent who &apos;s 13 and 14 , and he &apos;s been cer@@ ti@@ fied to stand trial as an adult .
I start thinking , well , how did that happen ?
How can a judge turn you into something that you &apos;re not ?
And the judge has cer@@ ti@@ fied him as an adult , but I see this kid .
And I was up too late one night and I starting thinking , well g@@ os@@ h , if the judge can turn you into something that you &apos;re not , the judge must have magic power .
Yeah , Br@@ yan , the judge has some magic power .
You should ask for some of that .
And because I was up too late , wasn &apos;t thinking real straight , I started working on a motion .
And I had a cli@@ ent who was 14 years old , a young , poor black kid .
And I started working on this motion , and the head of the motion was : &quot; Mo@@ tion to try my poor , 14@@ -year-old black male cli@@ ent like a privi@@ leg@@ ed , white 7@@ 5@@ -year-old corporate execu@@ tive . &quot;
And I put in my motion that there was pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ori@@ al mis@@ conduc@@ t and police mis@@ conduc@@ t and ju@@ di@@ cial mis@@ conduc@@ t .
There was a crazy line in there about how there &apos;s no conduc@@ t in this coun@@ ty , it &apos;s all mis@@ conduc@@ t .
And the next morning , I wo@@ ke up and I thought , now did I dream that crazy motion , or did I actually write it ?
And to my hor@@ ror , not only had I written it , but I had sent it to cour@@ t .
A couple months went by , and I had just for@@ gotten all about it .
And I finally decided , oh g@@ os@@ h , I &apos;ve got to go to the cour@@ t and do this crazy case .
And I got into my car and I was feeling really overwhel@@ med -- overwhel@@ med .
And I got in my car and I went to this cour@@ thou@@ se .
And I was thinking , this is going to be so difficult , so painful .
And I finally got out of the car and I started walking up to the cour@@ thou@@ se .
And as I was walking up the steps of this cour@@ thou@@ se , there was an older black man who was the j@@ an@@ it@@ or in this cour@@ thou@@ se .
When this man saw me , he came over to me and he said , &quot; Who are you ? &quot;
I said , &quot; I &apos;m a law@@ yer . &quot; He said , &quot; You &apos;re a law@@ yer ? &quot; I said , &quot; Yes , si@@ r . &quot;
And this man came over to me and he hu@@ gged me .
And he whi@@ s@@ per@@ ed in my ear .
He said , &quot; I &apos;m so proud of you . &quot;
And I have to tell you , it was ener@@ gi@@ zing .
It connected deeply with something in me about identity , about the capacity of every person to contribute to a community , to a perspective that is hope@@ ful .
Well I went into the cour@@ tro@@ om .
And as soon as I walked inside , the judge saw me coming in .
He said , &quot; Mr. Ste@@ ven@@ son , did you write this crazy motion ? &quot;
I said , &quot; Yes , si@@ r . I did . &quot; And we started argu@@ ing .
And people started coming in because they were just ou@@ tr@@ aged .
I had written these crazy things .
and assi@@ stant pros@@ ec@@ ut@@ ors and cl@@ er@@ k workers .
And before I knew it , the cour@@ tro@@ om was filled with people angry that we were talking about race , that we were talking about poverty , that we were talking about inequality .
And out of the corner of my eye , I could see this j@@ an@@ it@@ or p@@ ac@@ ing back and forth .
And he kept looking through the window , and he could hear all of this hol@@ ler .
He kept p@@ ac@@ ing back and forth .
came into the cour@@ tro@@ om and sat down behind me , almost at coun@@ sel table .
About 10 minutes later the judge said we would take a break .
And during the break there was a de@@ pu@@ ty sh@@ eri@@ ff who was off@@ ended that the j@@ an@@ it@@ or had come into cour@@ t .
And this de@@ pu@@ ty jump@@ ed up and he ran over to this older black man .
He said , &quot; J@@ im@@ my , what are you doing in this cour@@ tro@@ om ? &quot;
And this older black man stood up and he looked at that de@@ pu@@ ty and he looked at me and he said , &quot; I came into this cour@@ tro@@ om to tell this young man , keep your eyes on the pri@@ ze , hold on . &quot;
I &apos;ve come to TED because I believe that many of you understand that the moral ar@@ c of the universe is long , but it b@@ ends toward justice .
That we cannot be full evolved human beings until we care about human rights and basic dig@@ nity .
That all of our survival is tied to the survival of everyone .
That our vi@@ sions of technology and design and entertainment and creativity have to be married with vi@@ sions of humanity , compassion and justice .
And more than anything , for those of you who share that , I &apos;ve simply come to tell you to keep your eyes on the pri@@ ze , hold on .
Thank you very much .
So you heard and saw an obvious desire by this audience , this community , to help you on your way and to do something on this issue .
Other than writing a check , what could we do ?
Well there are opportunities all around us .
If you live in the state of California , for example , there &apos;s a refer@@ en@@ du@@ m coming up this spring where actually there &apos;s going to be an effort to re@@ direct some of the money we spend on the politics of p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment .
For example , here in California we &apos;re going to spend one billion dollars on the death pen@@ al@@ ty in the next five years -- one billion dollars .
And yet , 4@@ 6 percent of all hom@@ i@@ cide cases don &apos;t result in ar@@ rest .
5@@ 6 percent of all rap@@ e cases don &apos;t result .
So there &apos;s an opportunity to change that .
And this refer@@ en@@ du@@ m would pro@@ pose having those dollars go to law en@@ for@@ ce@@ ment and safety .
And I think that opportunity exists all around us .
There &apos;s been this huge decline in crime in America over the last three decades .
And part of the narrative of that is sometimes that it &apos;s about increased in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation rates .
What would you say to someone who believed that ?
Well actually the violent crime rate has rema@@ ined relatively stable .
The great increase in mass in@@ car@@ cer@@ ation in this country wasn &apos;t really in violent crime categ@@ ories .
It was this mis@@ gui@@ ded war on drugs .
That &apos;s where the dramatic increases have come in our prison population .
And we got carried away with the r@@ he@@ tor@@ ic of p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment .
And so we have three stri@@ kes laws that put people in prison forever for ste@@ aling a bicycle , for low-@@ level property cri@@ mes , rather than making them give those resources back to the people who they victi@@ mi@@ zed .
I believe we need to do more to help people who are victi@@ mi@@ zed by crime , not do less .
And I think our current p@@ uni@@ sh@@ ment philosophy does nothing for no one .
And I think that &apos;s the ori@@ en@@ tation that we have to change .
Br@@ yan , you &apos;ve struck a massive ch@@ ord here .
You &apos;re an inspiring person .
Thank you so much for coming to TED . Thank you .
I &apos;m going to speak about a tiny , little idea .
And this is about shifting bas@@ eline .
And because the idea can be explained in one minute , I will tell you three stories before to fill in the time .
And the first story is about Charles Darwin , one of my heroes .
And he was here , as you well know , in &apos; 35 .
And you &apos;d think he was ch@@ asing fin@@ ches , but he wasn &apos;t .
He was actually collecting fish .
And he described one of them as very &quot; common . &quot;
This was the sa@@ il@@ f@@ in grou@@ per .
A big fi@@ sh@@ ery was run on it until the &apos; 80s .
Now the fish is on the I@@ U@@ C@@ N Red Li@@ st .
Now this story , we have heard it lots of times on Gal@@ apa@@ gos and other places , so there is nothing particular about it .
But the point is , we still come to Gal@@ apa@@ gos .
We still think it is pri@@ sti@@ ne .
The bro@@ chu@@ res still say it is un@@ touched .
So what happens here ?
The second story , also to illustr@@ ate another concept , is called shifting wai@@ st@@ line .
Because I was there in &apos; 7@@ 1 , studying a la@@ go@@ on in West Africa .
I was there because I grew up in Europe and I wanted later to work in Africa .
And I thought I could bl@@ end in .
And I got a big sun@@ burn , and I was convinced that I was really not from there .
This was my first sun@@ burn .
And the la@@ go@@ on was surrounded by pal@@ m trees , as you can see , and a few man@@ gro@@ ve .
And it had ti@@ lap@@ ia about 20 centi@@ meters , a species of ti@@ lap@@ ia called bl@@ ack@@ ch@@ in ti@@ lap@@ ia .
And the fi@@ sh@@ eries for this ti@@ lap@@ ia susta@@ ined lots of fish and they had a good time and they ear@@ ned more than average in Ghana .
When I went there 27 years later , the fish had sh@@ run@@ k to half of their size .
They were mat@@ ur@@ ing at five centi@@ meters .
They had been pu@@ shed gene@@ tically .
There were still fi@@ shes .
They were still kind of happy .
And the fish also were happy to be there .
So nothing has changed , but everything has changed .
My third little story is that I was an accomp@@ li@@ ce in the intro@@ duction of tra@@ w@@ ling in Sou@@ the@@ ast Asia .
In the &apos; 7@@ 0s -- well , beginning in the &apos; 6@@ 0s -- Europe did lots of development projects .
F@@ ish development meant impos@@ ing on countries that had already 100,000 fi@@ sh@@ ers to imp@@ ose on them industrial fishing .
And this boat , quite ug@@ ly , is called the Mu@@ ti@@ ar@@ a 4 .
And I went sa@@ iling on it , and we did surve@@ ys throughout the sou@@ thern South China sea and especially the Ja@@ va Se@@ a .
And what we caught , we didn &apos;t have words for it .
What we caught , I know now , is the bottom of the sea .
And 90 percent of our catch were spo@@ ng@@ es , other animals that are fixed on the bottom .
And actually most of the fish , they are a little spot on the de@@ br@@ is , the pil@@ es of de@@ br@@ is , were coral ree@@ f fish .
E@@ ss@@ entially the bottom of the sea came onto the dec@@ k and then was thrown down .
And these pictures are extraordinary because this transition is very rap@@ id .
Wi@@ thin a year , you do a survey and then commercial fishing begins .
The bottom is transformed from , in this case , a hard bottom or soft coral into a mu@@ d@@ dy mess .
This is a dead tur@@ tle .
They were not e@@ aten , they were thrown away because they were dead .
And one time we caught a live one .
It was not dro@@ w@@ ned yet .
And then they wanted to kill it because it was good to eat .
This mountain of de@@ br@@ is is actually collected by fi@@ sh@@ ers every time they go into an area that &apos;s never been fi@@ shed .
But it &apos;s not docu@@ mented .
We transform the world , but we don &apos;t remember it .
We ad@@ just our bas@@ eline to the new level , and we don &apos;t rec@@ all what was there .
If you gener@@ alize this , something like this happens .
You have on the y axis some good thing : bio@@ diversity , numbers of or@@ ca , the gre@@ en@@ ness of your country , the water supply .
And over time it changes -- it changes because people do things , or naturally .
Every generation will use the images that they got at the beginning of their conscious lives as a standard and will ex@@ tr@@ ap@@ ol@@ ate forward .
And the difference then , they percei@@ ve as a loss .
But they don &apos;t percei@@ ve what happened before as a loss .
You can have a suc@@ c@@ ession of changes .
At the end you want to susta@@ in miser@@ able lef@@ to@@ vers .
And that , to a large extent , is what we want to do now .
We want to susta@@ in things that are gone or things that are not the way they were .
Now one should think this problem affected people certainly when in pred@@ atory societies , they killed animals and they didn &apos;t know they had done so after a few generations .
Because , obviously , an animal that is very abun@@ d@@ ant , before it gets extinct , it becomes rare .
So you don &apos;t lose abun@@ d@@ ant animals .
You always lose rare animals .
And therefore they &apos;re not percei@@ ved as a big loss .
Over time , we concentr@@ ate on large animals , and in a sea that means the big fish .
They become r@@ ar@@ er because we fish them .
Over time we have a few fish left and we think this is the bas@@ eline .
And the question is , why do people accept this ?
Well because they don &apos;t know that it was different .
And in fact , lots of people , scientists , will con@@ test that it was really different .
And they will con@@ test this because the evidence presented in an earlier mo@@ de is not in the way they would like the evidence presented .
For example , the an@@ ec@@ d@@ ote that some present , as Cap@@ tain so-@@ and-@@ so obser@@ ved lots of fish in this area cannot be used or is usually not u@@ tili@@ zed by fi@@ sh@@ ery scientists , because it &apos;s not &quot; scientific . &quot;
So you have a situation where people don &apos;t know the past , even though we live in liter@@ ate societies , because they don &apos;t trust the sources of the past .
And h@@ ence , the enormous role that a mar@@ ine protected area can play .
Because with mar@@ ine protected areas , we actually re@@ create the past .
We re@@ create the past that people cannot con@@ cei@@ ve because the bas@@ eline has shif@@ ted and is extremely low .
That is for people who can see a mar@@ ine protected area and who can benefit from the insight that it provi@@ des , which en@@ ables them to re@@ set their bas@@ eline .
How about the people who can &apos;t do that because they have no access -- the people in the M@@ id@@ west for example ?
There I think that the arts and film can perhaps fill the gap , and si@@ mulation .
This is a si@@ mulation of Ch@@ es@@ ap@@ ea@@ ke Bay .
There were gray whales in Ch@@ es@@ ap@@ ea@@ ke Bay a long time ago -- 500 years ago .
And you will have noticed that the hu@@ es and t@@ ones are like &quot; A@@ v@@ atar . &quot;
And if you think about &quot; A@@ v@@ atar , &quot; if you think of why people were so touched by it -- never mind the Po@@ ca@@ hon@@ t@@ as story -- why so touched by the imagery ?
Because it ev@@ o@@ kes something that in a sense has been lost .
And so my re@@ com@@ men@@ dation , it &apos;s the only one I will provide , is for Cam@@ er@@ on to do &quot; A@@ v@@ atar II &quot; underwater .
Thank you very much .
Do you know how many choices you make in a typical day ?
Do you know how many choices you make in typical week ?
I recently did a survey with over 2,000 Americans , and the average number of choices that the typical American repor@@ ts making is about 70 in a typical day .
There was also recently a study done with CE@@ Os in which they followed CE@@ Os around for a whole week .
And these scientists simply docu@@ mented all the various t@@ asks that these CE@@ Os engaged in and how much time they spent engaging in making decisions related to these t@@ asks .
And they found that the average CEO engaged in about 1@@ 3@@ 9 t@@ asks in a week .
Each task was made up of many , many , many sub-@@ choices of course .
50 percent of their decisions were made in nine minutes or less .
Only about 12 percent of the decisions did they make an hour or more of their time .
Think about your own choices .
Do you know how many choices make it into your nine minute categ@@ ory versus your one hour categ@@ ory ?
How well do you think you &apos;re doing at man@@ aging those choices ?
Today I want to talk about one of the biggest modern day choos@@ ing problems that we have , which is the choice over@@ load problem .
I want to talk about the problem and some potential solutions .
Now as I talk about this problem , I &apos;m going to have some questions for you and I &apos;m going to want to know your answers .
So when I ask you a question , since I &apos;m blind , only raise your hand if you want to burn off some cal@@ ories .
O@@ ther@@ wise , when I ask you a question , and if your answer is yes , I &apos;d like you to cla@@ p your hands .
So for my first question for you today : Are you guys ready to hear about the choice over@@ load problem ?
Thank you .
So when I was a graduate student at Stanford University , I used to go to this very , very up@@ scale gro@@ cer@@ y store ; at least at that time it was truly up@@ scale .
It was a store called D@@ ra@@ e@@ ger &apos;s .
Now this store , it was almost like going to an a@@ mu@@ se@@ ment park .
They had 250 different kinds of mu@@ star@@ ds and v@@ ine@@ gar@@ s and over 500 different kinds of fru@@ its and vege@@ tables and more than two dozen different kinds of bot@@ tled water -- and this was during a time when we actually used to drink ta@@ p water .
I used to love going to this store , but on one occa@@ sion I asked myself , well how come you never buy anything ?
Here &apos;s their o@@ live oil a@@ is@@ le .
They had over 75 different kinds of o@@ live oil , including those that were in a locked case that came from thous@@ and@@ -year-old o@@ live trees .
So I one day decided to pay a visit to the man@@ ager , and I asked the man@@ ager , &quot; Is this model of offer@@ ing people all this choice really working ? &quot;
And he pointed to the bu@@ slo@@ ads of tou@@ ri@@ sts that would show up everyday , with cameras ready usually .
We decided to do a little experiment , and we picked j@@ am for our experiment .
Here &apos;s their j@@ am a@@ is@@ le .
They had 3@@ 48 different kinds of j@@ am .
We set up a little t@@ as@@ ting bo@@ oth right near the en@@ tr@@ ance of the store .
We there put out six different fla@@ v@@ ors of j@@ am or 24 different fla@@ v@@ ors of j@@ am , and we looked at two things : First , in which case were people more likely to stop , sample some j@@ am ?
More people stopped when there were 24 , about 60 percent , than when there were six , about 40 percent .
The next thing we looked at is in which case were people more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
Now we see the opposite effect .
Of the people who stopped when there were 24 , only three percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
Of the people who stopped when there were six , well now we saw that 30 percent of them actually bought a j@@ ar of j@@ am .
Now if you do the math , people were at least six times more likely to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am if they encoun@@ tered six than if they encoun@@ tered 24 .
Now choos@@ ing not to buy a j@@ ar of j@@ am is probably good for us -- at least it &apos;s good for our wai@@ st@@ lines -- but it turns out that this choice over@@ load problem aff@@ ects us even in very consequ@@ ential decisions .
We choose not to choose , even when it goes against our best self-@@ interests .
So now for the topic of today : financial savings .
Now I &apos;m going to describe to you a study I did with G@@ ur Hu@@ ber@@ man , E@@ mi@@ r K@@ am@@ en@@ ica , We@@ i J@@ ang where we looked at the reti@@ rement savings decisions of nearly a million Americans from about 6@@ 50 plans all in the U.S.
And what we looked at was whether the number of fund offer@@ ings available in a reti@@ rement savings plan , the 40@@ 1 plan , does that affect people &apos;s like@@ li@@ hood to save more for tomorrow .
And what we found was that indeed there was a cor@@ relation .
So in these plans , we had about 6@@ 5@@ 7 plans that ran@@ ged from offer@@ ing people anywhere from two to 5@@ 9 different fund offer@@ ings .
And what we found was that , the more fun@@ ds offered , indeed , there was less particip@@ ation rate .
So if you look at the extre@@ mes , those plans that offered you two fun@@ ds , particip@@ ation rates were around in the mi@@ d-@@ 7@@ 0s -- still not as high as we want it to be .
In those plans that offered nearly 60 fun@@ ds , particip@@ ation rates have now dropped to about the 6@@ 0@@ th per@@ centi@@ le .
Now it turns out that even if you do choose to participate when there are more choices present , even then , it has negative consequences .
So for those people who did choose to participate , the more choices available , the more likely people were to completely avoid sto@@ cks or equ@@ ity fun@@ ds .
The more choices available , the more likely they were to put all their money in pure money market accoun@@ ts .
Now neither of these extreme decisions are the kinds of decisions that any of us would re@@ comm@@ end for people when you &apos;re consi@@ dering their future financial well-being .
Well , over the past decade , we have obser@@ ved three main negative consequences to offer@@ ing people more and more choices .
They &apos;re more likely to del@@ ay choos@@ ing -- pro@@ cr@@ as@@ tin@@ ate even when it goes against their best self-@@ interest .
They &apos;re more likely to make worse choices -- worse financial choices , medical choices .
They &apos;re more likely to choose things that make them less satis@@ fied , even when they do ob@@ jec@@ tively better .
The main reason for this is because , we might enjoy ga@@ zing at those giant walls of ma@@ y@@ on@@ na@@ ises , mu@@ star@@ ds , v@@ ine@@ gar@@ s , j@@ ams , but we can &apos;t actually do the math of compar@@ ing and contr@@ as@@ ting and actually pic@@ king from that stun@@ ning display .
So what I want to pro@@ pose to you today are four simple techniques -- techniques that we have tested in one way or another in different research venu@@ es -- that you can easily apply in your businesses .
The first : C@@ ut .
You &apos;ve heard it said before , but it &apos;s never been more true than today , that less is more .
People are always up@@ set when I say , &quot; C@@ ut . &quot;
They &apos;re always worried they &apos;re going to lose shel@@ f space .
But in fact , what we &apos;re seeing more and more is that if you are willing to cut , get rid of those ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous re@@ d@@ un@@ d@@ ant options , well there &apos;s an increase in sal@@ es , there &apos;s a lo@@ wering of costs , there is an impro@@ vement of the choos@@ ing experience .
When Pro@@ c@@ tor &amp; amp ; G@@ am@@ ble went from 26 different kinds of H@@ ead &amp; amp ; Sh@@ oul@@ ders to 15 , they saw an increase in sal@@ es by 10 percent .
When the Gol@@ den C@@ at Cor@@ por@@ ation got rid of their 10 wor@@ st-@@ selling cat lit@@ ter products , they saw an increase in prof@@ its by 8@@ 7 percent -- a function of both increase in sal@@ es and lo@@ wering of costs .
You know , the average gro@@ cer@@ y store today offers you 4@@ 5,000 products .
The typical Wal@@ mar@@ t today offers you 100,000 products .
But the n@@ in@@ th largest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er , the n@@ in@@ th biggest re@@ ta@@ il@@ er in the world today is Al@@ di , and it offers you only 1,@@ 400 products -- one kind of can@@ ned tom@@ a@@ to sau@@ ce .
Now in the financial savings world , I think one of the best examples that has recently come out on how to best manage the choice offer@@ ings has actually been something that David La@@ i@@ b@@ son was hea@@ vi@@ ly involved in designing , which was the program that they have at Harvard .
Every single Harvard employ@@ ee is now automa@@ tically en@@ rol@@ led in a lif@@ ec@@ y@@ cle fund .
For those people who actually want to choose , they &apos;re given 20 fun@@ ds , not 300 or more fun@@ ds .
You know , often , people say , &quot; I don &apos;t know how to cut .
They &apos;re all important choices . &quot;
And the first thing I do is I ask the employees , &quot; T@@ ell me how these choices are different from one another .
And if your employees can &apos;t tell them apart , neither can your consumers . &quot;
Now before we started our session this afternoon , I had a ch@@ at with G@@ ary .
And G@@ ary said that he would be willing to offer people in this audience an al@@ l-@@ expen@@ se@@ s-@@ paid free vac@@ ation to the most beautiful road in the world .
Here &apos;s a descrip@@ tion of the road .
And I &apos;d like you to read it .
And now I &apos;ll give you a few seconds to read it and then I want you to cla@@ p your hands if you &apos;re ready to take G@@ ary up on his offer .
Okay . Any@@ body who &apos;s ready to take him up on his offer .
Is that all ?
All right , let me show you some more about this .
You guys knew there was a trick , didn &apos;t you .
Now who &apos;s ready to go on this trip .
I think I might have actually heard more hands .
All right .
Now in fact , you had ob@@ jec@@ tively more information the first time around than the second time around , but I would venture to guess that you felt that it was more real the second time around .
Because the pictures made it feel more real to you .
Which brings me to the second technique for hand@@ ling the choice over@@ load problem , which is con@@ cre@@ ti@@ zation .
That in order for people to understand the differences between the choices , they have to be able to understand the consequences associated with each choice , and that the consequences need to be felt in a vi@@ vid sort of way , in a very concrete way .
Why do people spend an average of 15 to 30 percent more when they use an A@@ T@@ M card or a credit card as op@@ posed to c@@ ash ?
Because it doesn &apos;t feel like real money .
And it turns out that making it feel more concrete can actually be a very positive tool to use in getting people to save more .
So a study that I did with Sh@@ l@@ om@@ o Ben@@ art@@ z@@ i and A@@ less@@ and@@ ro P@@ rev@@ it@@ er@@ o , we did a study with people at IN@@ G -- employees that are all working at IN@@ G -- and now these people were all in a session where they &apos;re doing en@@ rol@@ l@@ ment for their 40@@ 1 plan .
And during that session , we kept the session exactly the way it used to be , but we added one little thing .
The one little thing we added was we asked people to just think about all the positive things that would happen in your life if you saved more .
By doing that simple thing , there was an increase in en@@ rol@@ l@@ ment by 20 percent and there was an increase in the amount of people willing to save or the amount that they were willing to put down into their savings account by four percent .
The third technique : C@@ ate@@ gori@@ zation .
We can handle more categ@@ ories than we can handle choices .
So for example , here &apos;s a study we did in a magazine a@@ is@@ le .
It turns out that in We@@ g@@ man@@ s gro@@ cer@@ y sto@@ res up and down the nor@@ the@@ ast cor@@ ri@@ d@@ or , the magazine a@@ is@@ les range anywhere from 3@@ 31 different kinds of magaz@@ ines all the way up to 6@@ 64 .
But you know what ?
If I show you 600 magaz@@ ines and I divide them up into 10 categ@@ ories , versus I show you 400 magaz@@ ines and divide them up into 20 categ@@ ories , you believe that I have given you more choice and a better choos@@ ing experience if I gave you the 400 than if I gave you the 600 .
Because the categ@@ ories tell me how to tell them apart .
Here are two different je@@ wel@@ ry disp@@ la@@ ys .
One is called &quot; Ja@@ zz &quot; and the other one is called &quot; S@@ wing . &quot;
If you think the display on the left is S@@ wing and the display on the right is Ja@@ zz , cla@@ p your hands .
Okay , there &apos;s some .
If you think the one on the left is Ja@@ zz and the one on the right is S@@ wing , cla@@ p your hands .
Okay , a bit more .
Now it turns out you &apos;re right .
The one on the left is Ja@@ zz and the one on the right is S@@ wing , but you know what ?
This is a highly u@@ sel@@ ess cate@@ gori@@ zation sche@@ me .
The categ@@ ories need to say something to the choos@@ er , not the cho@@ ic@@ e-@@ maker .
And you often see that problem when it comes down to those long li@@ sts of all these fun@@ ds .
Who are they actually supposed to be in@@ for@@ ming ?
My fourth technique : Con@@ dition for complexity .
It turns out we can actually handle a lot more information than we think we can , we &apos;ve just got to take it a little easier .
We have to gradu@@ ally increase the complexity .
I &apos;m going to show you one example of what I &apos;m talking about .
Let &apos;s take a very , very complicated decision : buying a car .
Here &apos;s a German car manufac@@ tu@@ rer that gives you the opportunity to completely cu@@ st@@ om make your car .
You &apos;ve got to make 60 different decisions , completely make up your car .
Now these decisions v@@ ary in the number of choices that they offer per decision .
C@@ ar colors , exter@@ ior car colors -- I &apos;ve got 5@@ 6 choices .
Eng@@ ines , ge@@ ar@@ shift -- four choices .
So now what I &apos;m going to do is I &apos;m going to v@@ ary the order in which these decisions appear .
So half of the customers are going to go from high choice , 5@@ 6 car colors , to low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts .
The other half of the customers are going to go from low choice , four ge@@ ar@@ shif@@ ts , to 5@@ 6 car colors , high choice .
What am I going to look at ?
How engaged you are .
If you keep h@@ itting the def@@ au@@ lt button per decision , that means you &apos;re getting overwhel@@ med , that means I &apos;m losing you .
What you find is the people who go from high choice to low choice , they &apos;re h@@ itting that def@@ au@@ lt button over and over and over again .
We &apos;re losing them .
They go from low choice to high choice , they &apos;re hang@@ ing in there .
It &apos;s the same information . It &apos;s the same number of choices .
The only thing that I have done is I have vari@@ ed the order in which that information is presented .
If I start you off easy , I learn how to choose .
Even though choos@@ ing ge@@ ar@@ shift doesn &apos;t tell me anything about my pre@@ fer@@ ences for inter@@ ior dec@@ or , it still prepar@@ es me for how to choose .
It also gets me excited about this big product that I &apos;m putting together , so I &apos;m more willing to be motiv@@ ated to be engaged .
So let me re@@ ca@@ p .
I have talked about four techniques for mi@@ ti@@ ga@@ ting the problem of choice over@@ load -- cut -- get rid of the ex@@ tran@@ e@@ ous alter@@ na@@ tives ; con@@ cre@@ tize -- make it real ; cate@@ gori@@ ze -- we can handle more categ@@ ories , less choices ; condition for complexity .
All of these techniques that I &apos;m descri@@ bing to you today are designed to help you manage your choices -- better for you , you can use them on yourself , better for the people that you are serving .
Because I believe that the key to getting the most from choice is to be choos@@ y about choos@@ ing .
And the more we &apos;re able to be choos@@ y about choos@@ ing the better we will be able to practice the art of choos@@ ing .
Thank you very much .
I think we have to do something about a piece of the culture of medicine that has to change .
And I think it starts with one physi@@ cian , and that &apos;s me .
And maybe I &apos;ve been around long enough that I can afford to give away some of my false pre@@ sti@@ ge to be able to do that .
Before I actually begin the meat of my talk , let &apos;s begin with a bit of base@@ ball .
Hey , why not ?
We &apos;re near the end , we &apos;re getting close to the World Ser@@ ies .
We all love base@@ ball , don &apos;t we ?
Ba@@ se@@ ball is filled with some amazing statistics .
And there &apos;s hundreds of them .
&quot; Mon@@ ey@@ ball &quot; is about to come out , and it &apos;s all about statistics and using statistics to build a great base@@ ball team .
I &apos;m going to focus on one st@@ at that I hope a lot of you have heard of .
It &apos;s called bat@@ ting average .
So we talk about a 300 , a bat@@ ter who b@@ ats 300 .
That means that bal@@ l@@ player bat@@ ted safe@@ ly , hit safe@@ ly three times out of 10 at b@@ ats .
That means hit the ball into the out@@ field , it dropped , it didn &apos;t get caught , and who@@ ever tried to throw it to first base didn &apos;t get there in time and the run@@ ner was safe .
Three times out of 10 .
Do you know what they call a 300 h@@ it@@ ter in Ma@@ j@@ or Lea@@ gue Ba@@ se@@ ball ?
Good , really good , maybe an al@@ l-@@ star .
Do you know what they call a 400 base@@ ball h@@ it@@ ter ?
That &apos;s somebody who hit , by the way , four times safe@@ ly out of every 10 .
Le@@ gen@@ dary -- as in Ted Willi@@ ams le@@ gen@@ dary -- the last Ma@@ j@@ or Lea@@ gue Ba@@ se@@ ball player to hit over 400 during a regular season .
Now let &apos;s take this back into my world of medicine where I &apos;m a lot more comfortable , or perhaps a bit less comfortable after what I &apos;m going to talk to you about .
Su@@ pp@@ ose you have app@@ en@@ di@@ ci@@ ti@@ s and you &apos;re refer@@ red to a surgeon who &apos;s bat@@ ting 400 on app@@ en@@ dec@@ tom@@ ies .
Some@@ how this isn &apos;t working out , is it ?
Now supp@@ ose you live in a certain part of a certain remote place and you have a loved one who has blo@@ ck@@ ages in two cor@@ on@@ ary ar@@ teries and your family doctor re@@ f@@ ers that loved one to a car@@ dio@@ logist who &apos;s bat@@ ting 200 on an@@ gi@@ op@@ la@@ sti@@ es .
But , but , you know what ?
She &apos;s doing a lot better this year . She &apos;s on the come@@ back tra@@ il .
And she &apos;s h@@ itting a 25@@ 7 .
Some@@ how this isn &apos;t working .
But I &apos;m going to ask you a question .
What do you think a bat@@ ting average for a car@@ di@@ ac surgeon or a nur@@ se practi@@ tion@@ er or an or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ dic surgeon , an O@@ B@@ G@@ Y@@ N , a para@@ medi@@ c is supposed to be ?
1,000 , very good .
Now truth of the matter is , nobody knows in all of medicine what a good surgeon or physi@@ cian or para@@ medi@@ c is supposed to b@@ at .
What we do though is we send each one of them , including myself , out into the world with the ad@@ mon@@ ition , be perfect .
N@@ ever ever , ever make a mistake , but you worry about the details , about how that &apos;s going to happen .
And that was the message that I absor@@ bed when I was in med school .
I was an obse@@ ssive compu@@ l@@ sive student .
In high school , a class@@ mate once said that Brian Gol@@ d@@ man would study for a blood test .
And so I did .
And I studied in my little gar@@ re@@ t at the nurses &apos; resi@@ dence at Tor@@ onto Gener@@ al H@@ os@@ pit@@ al , not far from here .
And I memor@@ ized everything .
I memor@@ ized in my an@@ at@@ omy class the orig@@ ins and ex@@ er@@ tions of every musc@@ le , every bran@@ ch of every ar@@ tery that came off the a@@ or@@ ta , differ@@ ential diagnos@@ es ob@@ s@@ cure and common .
I even knew the differ@@ ential diagnos@@ is in how to classi@@ fy ren@@ al tu@@ bu@@ lar ac@@ id@@ os@@ is .
And all the while , I was ama@@ ssing more and more knowledge .
And I did well , I gradu@@ ated with hon@@ ors , cu@@ m lau@@ de .
And I came out of medical school with the impre@@ ssion that if I memor@@ ized everything and knew everything , or as much as possible , as close to everything as possible , that it would immu@@ ni@@ ze me against making mistakes .
And it worked for a while , until I met M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er .
I was a resident at a teaching hospital here in Tor@@ onto when M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er was brought to the emer@@ gency department of the hospital where I was working .
At the time I was as@@ signed to the car@@ di@@ ology service on a car@@ di@@ ology rot@@ ation .
And it was my job , when the emer@@ gency staff called for a car@@ di@@ ology con@@ sul@@ t , to see that patient in emer@@ g .
and to report back to my atten@@ ding .
And I saw M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er , and she was brea@@ th@@ less .
And when I list@@ ened to her , she was making a wh@@ ee@@ zy sound .
And when I list@@ ened to her chest with a ste@@ th@@ os@@ cope , I could hear cr@@ ack@@ ly sounds on both sides that told me that she was in cong@@ es@@ tive heart failure .
This is a condition in which the heart fail@@ s , and instead of being able to pu@@ mp all the blood forward , some of the blood b@@ acks up into the lung , the lu@@ ngs fill up with blood , and that &apos;s why you have short@@ ness of breath .
And that wasn &apos;t a difficult diagnos@@ is to make .
I made it and I set to work tr@@ eating her .
I gave her asp@@ ir@@ in . I gave her medi@@ cations to reli@@ e@@ ve the stra@@ in on her heart .
I gave her medi@@ cations that we call di@@ u@@ re@@ tics , water p@@ ills , to get her to pe@@ e out the access flu@@ id .
And over the course of the next hour and a half or two , she started to feel better .
And I felt really good .
And that &apos;s when I made my first mistake ; I sent her home .
Actually , I made two more mistakes .
I sent her home without speaking to my atten@@ ding .
I didn &apos;t pick up the phone and do what I was supposed to do , which was call my atten@@ ding and run the story by him so he would have a chance to see her for himself .
And he knew her , he would have been able to fur@@ ni@@ sh addi@@ tional information about her .
Maybe I did it for a good reason .
Maybe I didn &apos;t want to be a high-@@ ma@@ inten@@ ance resident .
Maybe I wanted to be so successful and so able to take responsibility that I would do so and I would be able to take care of my atten@@ ding &apos;s patients without even having to contact him .
The second mistake that I made was worse .
In sending her home , I dis@@ regar@@ ded a little voice deep down inside that was trying to tell me , &quot; Gol@@ d@@ man , not a good idea . Don &apos;t do this . &quot;
In fact , so l@@ acking in confidence was I that I actually asked the nur@@ se who was looking after M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er , &quot; Do you think it &apos;s okay if she goes home ? &quot;
And the nur@@ se thought about it and said very mat@@ ter-@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly , &quot; Yeah , I think she &apos;ll do okay . &quot;
I can remember that like it was yesterday .
So I signed the dis@@ charge papers , and an am@@ bul@@ ance came , para@@ medi@@ cs came to take her home .
And I went back to my work on the wards .
All the rest of that day , that afternoon , I had this kind of g@@ na@@ wing feeling inside my stom@@ ach .
But I carried on with my work .
And at the end of the day , I p@@ acked up to leave the hospital and walked to the parking lot to take my car and drive home when I did something that I don &apos;t usually do .
I walked through the emer@@ gency department on my way home .
And it was there that another nur@@ se , not the nur@@ se who was looking after M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er before , but another nur@@ se , said three words to me that are the three words that most emer@@ gency physi@@ cians I know dre@@ ad .
O@@ thers in medicine dre@@ ad them as well , but there &apos;s something particular about emer@@ gency medicine because we see patients so fle@@ e@@ ti@@ ngly .
The three words are : Do you remember ?
&quot; Do you remember that patient you sent home ? &quot;
the other nur@@ se asked mat@@ ter-@@ of-@@ fac@@ tly .
&quot; Well she &apos;s back , &quot; in just that t@@ one of voice .
Well she was back all right .
She was back and near death .
About an hour after she had arrived home , after I &apos;d sent her home , she collap@@ sed and her family called 9@@ 11 and the para@@ medi@@ cs brought her back to the emer@@ gency department where she had a blood pressure of 50 , which is in severe shock .
And she was b@@ arely breathing and she was blue .
And the emer@@ g@@ . staff pulled out all the stop@@ s .
They gave her medi@@ cations to raise her blood pressure .
They put her on a v@@ enti@@ l@@ ator .
And I was sho@@ cked and sha@@ ken to the core .
And I went through this rol@@ ler co@@ a@@ ster , because after they st@@ abi@@ li@@ zed her , she went to the inten@@ sive care unit , and I ho@@ ped against hope that she would re@@ cover .
And over the next two or three days , it was clear that she was never going to wake up .
She had ir@@ rever@@ sible brain damage .
And the family gather@@ ed .
And over the course of the next eight or nine days , they re@@ signed themselves to what was happening .
And at about the nine day mark , they let her go -- M@@ r@@ s@@ . D@@ ru@@ ck@@ er , a wife , a mother and a grandmother .
They say you never forget the names of those who die .
And that was my first time to be ac@@ qua@@ in@@ ted with that .
Over the next few weeks , I beat myself up and I experienced for the first time the unh@@ eal@@ thy shame that exists in our culture of medicine -- where I felt alone , is@@ ol@@ ated , not feeling the healthy kind of shame that you feel , because you can &apos;t talk about it with your colleagues .
You know that healthy kind , when you be@@ tr@@ ay a secret that a best friend made you promise never to reveal and then you get bu@@ sted and then your best friend con@@ fron@@ ts you and you have terrible discu@@ ssions , but at the end of it all that sick feeling gu@@ id@@ es you and you say , I &apos;ll never make that mistake again .
And you make am@@ ends and you never make that mistake again .
That &apos;s the kind of shame that is a teacher .
The unh@@ eal@@ thy shame I &apos;m talking about is the one that makes you so sick inside .
It &apos;s the one that says , not that what you did was bad , but that you are bad .
And it was what I was feeling .
And it wasn &apos;t because of my atten@@ ding ; he was a dol@@ l .
He talked to the family , and I &apos;m quite sure that he smo@@ o@@ the@@ d things over and made sure that I didn &apos;t get su@@ ed .
And I kept asking myself these questions .
Why didn &apos;t I ask my atten@@ ding ? Why did I send her home ?
And then at my worst moments : Why did I make such a stupid mistake ?
Why did I go into medicine ?
S@@ low@@ ly but surely , it lif@@ ted .
I began to feel a bit better .
And on a clou@@ dy day , there was a cr@@ ack in the clouds and the sun started to come out and I wondered , maybe I could feel better again .
And I made myself a bar@@ gain that if only I re@@ double my efforts to be perfect and never make another mistake again , please make the voices stop .
And they did .
And I went back to work .
And then it happened again .
Two years later I was an atten@@ ding in the emer@@ gency department at a community hospital just north of Tor@@ onto , and I saw a 25 year-old man with a s@@ ore thro@@ at .
It was busy , I was in a bit of a hur@@ ry .
He kept pointing here .
I looked at his thro@@ at , it was a little bit p@@ ink .
And I gave him a pres@@ crip@@ tion for pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in and sent him on his way .
And even as he was walking out the door , he was still sort of pointing to his thro@@ at .
And two days later I came to do my next emer@@ gency shift , and that &apos;s when my chi@@ ef asked to speak to me qui@@ e@@ tly in her office .
And she said the three words : Do you remember ?
&quot; Do you remember that patient you saw with the s@@ ore thro@@ at ? &quot;
Well it turns out , he didn &apos;t have a str@@ ep thro@@ at .
He had a potentially life-@@ threat@@ ening condition called epi@@ gl@@ ot@@ ti@@ ti@@ s .
You can Google it , but it &apos;s an inf@@ ection , not of the thro@@ at , but of the upper air@@ way , and it can actually cause the air@@ way to close .
And fortunately he didn &apos;t die .
He was placed on in@@ tra@@ ven@@ ous antibiotics and he re@@ covered after a few days .
And I went through the same period of shame and re@@ crimin@@ ations and felt cle@@ ans@@ ed and went back to work , until it happened again and again and again .
T@@ wi@@ ce in one emer@@ gency shift , I missed app@@ en@@ di@@ ci@@ ti@@ s .
Now that takes some doing , especially when you work in a hospital that at the time saw but 14 people a night .
Now in both cases , I didn &apos;t send them home and I don &apos;t think there was any gap in their care .
One I thought had a kid@@ ney stone .
I or@@ dered a kid@@ ney X-@@ ray . When it turned out to be normal , my colleagu@@ e who was doing a reas@@ se@@ ss@@ ment of the patient noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ant and called the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
The other one had a lot of di@@ ar@@ r@@ he@@ a .
I or@@ dered some flu@@ ids to re@@ hy@@ dr@@ ate him and asked my colleagu@@ e to reas@@ se@@ ss him .
And he did and when he noticed some ten@@ der@@ ness in the right lower qu@@ ad@@ r@@ ant , called the sur@@ ge@@ ons .
In both cases , they had their oper@@ ations and they did okay .
But each time , they were g@@ na@@ wing at me , eating at me .
And I &apos;d like to be able to say to you that my worst mistakes only happened in the first five years of practice as many of my colleagues say , which is total B@@ .@@ S.
Some of my do@@ o@@ z@@ ies have been in the last five years .
Al@@ one , as@@ ha@@ med and un@@ suppor@@ ted .
Here &apos;s the problem : If I can &apos;t come clean and talk about my mistakes , if I can &apos;t find the sti@@ l@@ l-@@ small voice that tells me what really happened , how can I share it with my colleagues ?
How can I teach them about what I did so that they don &apos;t do the same thing ?
If I were to walk into a room -- like right now , I have no idea what you think of me .
When was the last time you heard somebody talk about failure after failure after failure ?
Oh yeah , you go to a cock@@ tail party and you might hear about some other doctor , but you &apos;re not going to hear somebody talking about their own mistakes .
If I were to walk into a room filled with my colle@@ ages and ask for their support right now and start to tell what I &apos;ve just told you right now , I probably wouldn &apos;t get through two of those stories before they would start to get really un@@ comfortable , somebody would cr@@ ack a joke , they &apos;d change the subject and we would move on .
And in fact , if I knew and my colleagues knew that one of my or@@ th@@ op@@ e@@ dic colleagues took off the wrong leg in my hospital , believe me , I &apos;d have trouble making eye contact with that person .
That &apos;s the system that we have .
It &apos;s a complete den@@ ial of mistakes .
It &apos;s a system in which there are two kinds of physi@@ cians -- those who make mistakes and those who don &apos;t , those who can &apos;t handle sleep de@@ pri@@ vation and those who can , those who have l@@ ous@@ y outcomes and those who have great outcomes .
And it &apos;s almost like an ide@@ ological reaction , like the anti@@ bodies begin to attack that person .
And we have this idea that if we drive the people who make mistakes out of medicine , what will we be left with , but a safe system .
But there are two problems with that .
In my 20 years or so of medical broad@@ cas@@ ting and journ@@ alism , I &apos;ve made a personal study of medical mal@@ practice and medical er@@ rors to learn everything I can , from one of the first artic@@ les I wrote for the Tor@@ onto S@@ tar to my show &quot; White Co@@ at , B@@ lack Art . &quot;
And what I &apos;ve learned is that er@@ rors are absolutely u@@ bi@@ quit@@ ous .
We work in a system where er@@ rors happen every day , where one in 10 medi@@ cations are either the wrong medi@@ cation given in hospital or at the wrong d@@ os@@ age , where hospit@@ al-@@ acqui@@ red inf@@ ections are getting more and more nu@@ mer@@ ous , causing ha@@ vo@@ c and death .
In this country , as many as 2@@ 4,000 Can@@ a@@ di@@ ans die of preven@@ table medical er@@ rors .
In the United States , the Institute of Me@@ dic@@ ine pe@@ gged it at 100,000 .
In both cases , these are gr@@ oss under@@ esti@@ mates , because we really aren &apos;t fer@@ re@@ ting out the problem as we should .
And here &apos;s the thing .
In a hospital system where medical knowledge is doub@@ ling every two or three years , we can &apos;t keep up with it .
S@@ leep de@@ pri@@ vation is absolutely per@@ va@@ sive .
We can &apos;t get rid of it .
We have our cognitive bi@@ ases , so that I can take a perfect history on a patient with chest pain .
Now take the same patient with chest pain , make them mo@@ ist and gar@@ ru@@ l@@ ous and put a little bit of al@@ coho@@ l on their breath , and suddenly my history is l@@ ac@@ ed with con@@ temp@@ t .
I don &apos;t take the same history .
I &apos;m not a robot ; I don &apos;t do things the same way each time .
And my patients aren &apos;t cars ; they don &apos;t tell me their symptoms in the same way each time .
Gi@@ ven all of that , mistakes are inev@@ itable .
So if you take the system , as I was taught , and we@@ ed out all the er@@ r@@ or@@ -@@ pr@@ one health profession@@ als , well there won &apos;t be anybody left .
And you know that business about people not wanting to talk about their worst cases ?
On my show , on &quot; White Co@@ at , B@@ lack Art , &quot; I made it a ha@@ bit of saying , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; I would say to everybody from para@@ medi@@ cs to the chi@@ ef of car@@ di@@ ac surgery , &quot; Here &apos;s my worst mistake , &quot; bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , bla@@ h , &quot; What about y@@ ours ? &quot; and I would point the micro@@ phone towards them .
And their pu@@ p@@ ils would di@@ late , they would reco@@ il , then they would look down and s@@ wal@@ low hard and start to tell me their stories .
They want to tell their stories . They want to share their stories .
They want to be able to say , &quot; Look , don &apos;t make the same mistake I did . &quot;
What they need is an environment to be able to do that .
What they need is a re@@ defined medical culture .
And it starts with one physi@@ cian at a time .
The re@@ defined physi@@ cian is human , knows she &apos;s human , accep@@ ts it , isn &apos;t proud of making mistakes , but stri@@ ves to learn one thing from what happened that she can teach to somebody else .
She shares her experience with others .
She &apos;s suppor@@ tive when other people talk about their mistakes .
And she points out other people &apos;s mistakes , not in a got@@ cha way , but in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way so that everybody can benefit .
And she works in a culture of medicine that ac@@ knowle@@ dges that human beings run the system , and when human beings run the system , they will make mistakes from time to time .
So the system is evol@@ ving to create back@@ u@@ ps that make it easier to detect those mistakes that humans inev@@ it@@ ably make and also fos@@ ters in a lo@@ ving , suppor@@ tive way places where everybody who is obser@@ ving in the health care system can actually point out things that could be potential mistakes and is re@@ war@@ ded for doing so , and especially people like me , when we do make mistakes , we &apos;re re@@ war@@ ded for coming clean .
My name is Brian Gol@@ d@@ man .
I am a re@@ defined physi@@ cian .
I &apos;m human . I make mistakes .
I &apos;m sorry about that , but I stri@@ ve to learn one thing that I can pass on to other people .
I still don &apos;t know what you think of me , but I can live with that .
And let me close with three words of my own : I do remember .
Hi . I &apos;m Kevin Al@@ loc@@ ca , I &apos;m the tr@@ ends man@@ ager at YouTube , and I profession@@ ally watch YouTube videos .
It &apos;s true .
So we &apos;re going to talk a little bit today about how videos go vir@@ al and then why that even matters .
We all want to be stars -- cele@@ bri@@ ties , sing@@ ers , come@@ di@@ ans -- and when I was younger , that seemed so very , very hard to do .
But now Web video has made it so that any of us or any of the creative things that we do can become completely famous in a part of our world &apos;s culture .
An@@ y one of you could be famous on the Internet by next Satur@@ day .
But there are over 48 hours of video up@@ lo@@ aded to YouTube every minute .
And of that , only a tiny percentage ever goes vir@@ al and gets tons of views and becomes a cultural moment .
So how does it happen ?
Three things : ta@@ st@@ ema@@ kers , communities of particip@@ ation and unexp@@ ec@@ te@@ dness .
All right , let &apos;s go .
Oh , my God . Oh , my God .
Oh , my God !
W@@ oo@@ o !
O@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h , w@@ ow@@ w@@ w@@ w !
Last year , B@@ ear V@@ as@@ qu@@ e@@ z pos@@ ted this video that he had shot outside his home in Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite National Park .
In 2010 , it was viewed 23 million times .
This is a chart of what it looked like when it first became popular last summer .
But he didn &apos;t actually set out to make a vir@@ al video , B@@ ear .
He just wanted to share a rain@@ bow .
Because that &apos;s what you do when your name is Y@@ os@@ em@@ ite M@@ oun@@ tain B@@ ear .
And he had pos@@ ted lots of nature videos in fact .
And this video had actually been pos@@ ted all the way back in January .
So what happened here ?
J@@ im@@ my K@@ im@@ me@@ l actually .
J@@ im@@ my K@@ im@@ me@@ l pos@@ ted this tw@@ eet that would eventually pro@@ pe@@ l the video to be as popular as it would become .
Because ta@@ st@@ ema@@ kers like J@@ im@@ my K@@ im@@ me@@ l introduce us to new and interesting things and bring them to a larger audience .
It &apos;s Fri@@ day , Fri@@ day . G@@ ot@@ ta get down on Fri@@ day . Everybody &apos;s looking forward to the wee@@ k@@ end , wee@@ k@@ end . Fri@@ day , Fri@@ day . G@@ et@@ tin &apos; down on Fri@@ day . So you didn &apos;t think that we could actually have this conversation without talking about this video I hope .
Re@@ bec@@ ca B@@ lack &apos;s &quot; Fri@@ day &quot; is one of the most popular videos of the year .
It &apos;s been seen nearly 200 million times this year .
This is a chart of what it looked like .
And similar to &quot; Dou@@ ble Ra@@ in@@ bow , &quot; it seems to have just sp@@ rou@@ ted up out of nowhere .
So what happened on this day ?
Well it was a Fri@@ day , this is true .
And if you &apos;re wondering about those other spi@@ kes , those are also Fri@@ days .
But what about this day , this one particular Fri@@ day ?
Well T@@ os@@ h@@ .@@ 0 picked it up , a lot of blo@@ gs starting writing about .
Michael J@@ . Nelson from M@@ yst@@ ery Science The@@ ater was one of the first people to post a joke about the video on Twitter .
But what &apos;s important is that an individual or a group of ta@@ st@@ ema@@ kers took a point of view and they shared that with a larger audience , acceler@@ ating the process .
And so then this community formed of people who shared this big inside joke and they started talking about it and doing things with it .
And now there are 10,000 par@@ o@@ dies of &quot; Fri@@ day &quot; on YouTube .
Even in the first seven days , there was one par@@ o@@ dy for every other day of the week .
Un@@ like the one-@@ way entertainment of the 20th century , this community particip@@ ation is how we become a part of the phenomenon -- either by spreading it or by doing something new with it .
So &quot; N@@ yan C@@ at &quot; is a lo@@ op@@ ed animation with lo@@ op@@ ed music .
It &apos;s this , just like this .
It &apos;s been viewed nearly 50 million times this year .
And if you think that that is weird , you should know that there is a three-@@ hour version of this that &apos;s been viewed four million times .
Even cats were watching this video .
C@@ ats were watching other cats watch this video .
But what &apos;s important here is the creativity that it inspired amongst this te@@ chi@@ e , ge@@ e@@ ky Internet culture .
There were re@@ mi@@ xes .
Some@@ one made an old ti@@ me@@ y version .
And then it went international .
An entire re@@ mix community sp@@ rou@@ ted up that brought it from being just a stupid joke to something that we can all actually be a part of .
Because we don &apos;t just enjoy now , we participate .
And who could have predic@@ ted any of this ?
Who could have predic@@ ted &quot; Dou@@ ble Ra@@ in@@ bow &quot; or Re@@ bec@@ ca B@@ lack or &quot; N@@ yan C@@ at ? &quot;
What s@@ crip@@ ts could you have written that would have conta@@ ined this in it ?
In a world where over two days of video get up@@ lo@@ aded every minute , only that which is truly unique and unexpected can stand out in the way that these things have .
When a friend of mine told me that I needed to see this great video about a guy prot@@ esting bicycle fin@@ es in New York City , I admit I wasn &apos;t very interested .
So I got a tic@@ ket for not ri@@ ding in the bike lan@@ e , but often there are ob@@ struc@@ tions that keep you from properly ri@@ ding in the bike lan@@ e .
By being totally surprising and hu@@ mor@@ ous , Ca@@ sey Ni@@ est@@ at got his funny idea and point seen five million times .
And so this approach holds for anything new that we do crea@@ tively .
And so it all brings us to one big question ...
What does this mean ?
O@@ h@@ h@@ h@@ h .
What does it mean ?
Ta@@ st@@ ema@@ kers , creative partici@@ pa@@ ting communities , complete unexp@@ ec@@ te@@ dness , these are character@@ istics of a new kind of media and a new kind of culture where anyone has access and the audience defin@@ es the popu@@ lar@@ ity .
I mean , as mentioned earlier , one of the biggest stars in the world right now , J@@ us@@ tin Bi@@ e@@ ber , got his start on YouTube .
No one has to gre@@ en@@ -@@ light your idea .
And we all now feel some ow@@ nership in our own pop culture .
And these are not character@@ istics of old media , and they &apos;re b@@ arely true of the media of today , but they will define the entertainment of the future .
Thank you .
Today I &apos;m going to talk about unexpected disco@@ ver@@ ies .
Now I work in the solar technology industry .
And my small star@@ tu@@ p is looking to force ourselves into the environment by paying attention to ...
... paying attention to crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
It &apos;s just a quick video of what we do .
Hu@@ h . H@@ ang on a moment .
It might take a moment to load .
We &apos;ll just -- we can just ski@@ p -- I &apos;ll just ski@@ p through the video instead ...
No .
This is not ...
Okay .
So@@ lar technology is ...
Oh , that &apos;s all my time ?
Okay . Thank you very much .
My story begins right here actually in Ra@@ j@@ as@@ than about two years ago .
I was in the desert , under the star@@ ry ski@@ es with the Su@@ f@@ i sing@@ er Mu@@ kh@@ ti@@ ar Al@@ i .
And we were in conversation about how nothing had changed since the time of the ancient Indian e@@ pic &quot; The Ma@@ ha@@ b@@ har@@ a@@ ta . &quot;
So back in the day , when us Indi@@ ans wanted to travel we &apos;d jump into a ch@@ ari@@ ot and we &apos;d zoom across the sky .
Now we do the same with air@@ planes .
B@@ ack then , when Ar@@ j@@ un@@ a , the great Indian war@@ ri@@ or prin@@ ce , when he was thir@@ sty , he &apos;d take out a bow , he &apos;d shoot it into the ground and water would come out .
Now we do the same with dri@@ l@@ ls and machines .
The conclusion that we came to was that magic had been re@@ placed by mach@@ in@@ ery .
And this made me really sad .
I found myself becoming a little bit of a techno@@ ph@@ o@@ be .
I was terri@@ fied by this idea that I would lose the ability to enjoy and appreciate the sun@@ set without having my camera on me , without tw@@ ee@@ ting it to my friends .
And it felt like technology should enable magic , not kill it .
When I was a little girl , my grandfather gave me his little sil@@ ver pocket watch .
And this piece of 50@@ -year-old technology became the most magi@@ cal thing to me .
It became a gi@@ l@@ ded g@@ ate@@ way into a world full of p@@ ir@@ ates and shi@@ p@@ w@@ rec@@ ks and images in my imagination .
So I felt like our cell@@ phones and our f@@ ancy wat@@ ches and our cameras had stopped us from dre@@ aming .
They stopped us from being inspired .
And so I jump@@ ed in , I jump@@ ed into this world of technology , to see how I could use it to enable magic as op@@ posed to kill it .
I &apos;ve been illustr@@ ating books since I was 16 .
And so when I saw the iP@@ ad , I saw it as a story@@ telling device that could connect read@@ ers all over the world .
It can know how we &apos;re holding it .
It can know where we are .
It brings together image and text and animation and sound and touch .
St@@ or@@ y@@ telling is becoming more and more multi-@@ sens@@ ori@@ al .
But what are we doing with it ?
So I &apos;m actually just going to go in and launch K@@ ho@@ ya , an interactive app for the iP@@ ad .
So it says , &quot; P@@ l@@ ace your fingers upon each light . &quot;
And so -- It says , &quot; This box be@@ lo@@ ngs to ... &quot; And so I type in my name .
And actually I become a character in the book .
At various points , a little letter dro@@ ps down to me -- and the iP@@ ad knows where you live because of GPS -- which is actually addre@@ ssed to me .
The child in me is really excited by these kinds of possibilities .
Now I &apos;ve been talking a lot about magic .
And I don &apos;t mean wi@@ z@@ ards and dra@@ g@@ ons , I mean the kind of childhood magic , those ideas that we all har@@ bo@@ red as children .
This idea of fire@@ flies in a j@@ ar , for some reason , was always really exciting to me .
And so over here you need to ti@@ lt your iP@@ ad , take the fire@@ flies out .
And they actually illu@@ min@@ ate your way through the rest of the book .
Another idea that really fascinated me as a child was that an entire galaxy could be conta@@ ined within a single mar@@ ble .
And so over here , each book and each world becomes a little mar@@ ble that I dra@@ g in to this magi@@ cal device within the device .
And it op@@ ens up a map .
All along , all fant@@ asy books have always had maps , but these maps have been sta@@ tic .
This is a map that grows and glo@@ ws and becomes your navi@@ gation for the rest of the book .
It reve@@ als itself to you at certain points in the book as well .
So I &apos;m just going to enter in .
Another thing that &apos;s actually really important to me is creating content that is Indian and yet very con@@ temporary .
Over here , these are the A@@ p@@ s@@ ar@@ as .
So we &apos;ve all heard about fa@@ i@@ ries and we &apos;ve all heard about n@@ y@@ m@@ ph@@ s , but how many people outside of India know about their Indian counter@@ parts , the A@@ p@@ s@@ ar@@ as ?
These poor A@@ p@@ s@@ ar@@ as have been tr@@ apped inside In@@ d@@ ra &apos;s ch@@ am@@ b@@ ers for thousands of years in an old and mu@@ sty book .
And so we &apos;re bringing them back in a con@@ temporary story for children .
And a story that actually de@@ als with new issues like the environmental crisis .
Spe@@ a@@ king of the environmental crisis , I think a big problem has been in the last 10 years is that children have been locked inside their rooms , glu@@ ed to their P@@ C@@ s , they haven &apos;t been able to get out .
But now with mobile technology , we can actually take our children outside into the natural world with their technology .
One of the interactions in the book is that you &apos;re sent off on this quest where you need to go outside , take out your camera on the iP@@ ad and collect pictures of different natural objects .
When I was a child , I had multiple coll@@ ections of sticks and st@@ ones and pe@@ bb@@ les and shel@@ ls .
And somehow kids don &apos;t do that anymore .
So in bringing back this childhood rit@@ ual , you need to go out and , in one chap@@ ter , take a picture of a flower and then ta@@ g it .
In another chap@@ ter , you need to take a picture of a piece of bar@@ k and then ta@@ g that .
And what happens is that you actually create a digital collection of photographs that you can then put up online .
A child in London puts up a picture of a fo@@ x and says , &quot; Oh , I saw a fo@@ x today . &quot;
A child in India says , &quot; I saw a monkey today . &quot;
And it creates this kind of social network around a collection of digital photographs that you &apos;ve actually taken .
In the possibilities of lin@@ king together magic , the earth and technology , there are multiple possibilities .
In the next book , we plan on having an interaction where you take your iP@@ ad out with the video on and through au@@ g@@ mented reality , you see this layer of anim@@ ated pi@@ xies appear on a house@@ plant that &apos;s outside your house .
At one point , your screen is filled up with leaves .
And so you need to make the sound of wind and b@@ low them away and read the rest of the book .
We &apos;re moving , we &apos;re all moving here , to a world where the forces of nature come closer together to technology , and magic and technology can come closer together .
We &apos;re har@@ ne@@ ssing energy from the sun .
We &apos;re bringing our children and ourselves closer to the natural world and that magic and joy and childhood love that we had through the simple medium of a story .
Thank you .
Because I usually take the role of trying to explain to people how wonderful the new technologies that are coming along are going to be , and I thought that , since I was among friends here , I would tell you what I really think and try to look back and try to understand what is really going on here with these amazing ju@@ mps in technology that seem so fast that we can b@@ arely keep on top of it .
So I &apos;m going to start out by showing just one very boring technology slide .
And then , so if you can just turn on the slide that &apos;s on .
This is just a random slide that I picked out of my file .
What I want to show you is not so much the details of the slide , but the general form of it .
This happens to be a slide of some analysis that we were doing about the power of R@@ I@@ S@@ C micro@@ process@@ ors versus the power of local area networks .
And the interesting thing about it is that this slide , like so many technology slides that we &apos;re used to , is a sort of a straight line on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g curve .
In other words , every step here represents an order of mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de in performance scale .
And this is a new thing that we talk about technology on se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves .
Some@@ thing really weird is going on here .
And that &apos;s basically what I &apos;m going to be talking about .
So , if you could bring up the lights .
If you could bring up the lights higher , because I &apos;m just going to use a piece of paper here .
Now why do we draw technology cur@@ ves in se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g cur@@ ves ?
Well the answer is , if I drew it on a normal curve where , let &apos;s say , this is years , this is time of some sort , and this is whatever measure of the technology that I &apos;m trying to graph , the graph@@ s look sort of sil@@ ly .
They sort of go like this .
And they don &apos;t tell us much .
Now if I graph , for instance , some other technology , say transportation technology , on a se@@ mi@@ -@@ lo@@ g curve , it would look very stupid , it would look like a flat line .
But when something like this happens , things are qu@@ al@@ it@@ a@@ tively changing .
So if transportation technology was moving along as fast as micro@@ process@@ or technology , then the day after tomorrow , I would be able to get in a ta@@ xi ca@@ b and be in To@@ ky@@ o in 30 seconds .
It &apos;s not moving like that .
And there &apos;s nothing prece@@ den@@ ted in the history of technology development of this kind of self-@@ feeding growth where you go by orders of mag@@ nit@@ u@@ de every few years .
Now the question that I &apos;d like to ask is , if you look at these exp@@ on@@ ential cur@@ ves , they don &apos;t go on forever .
Th@@ ings just can &apos;t possibly keep changing as fast as they are .
One of two things is going to happen .
E@@ ither it &apos;s going to turn into a sort of classical S@@ -@@ curve like this , until something totally different comes along , or maybe it &apos;s going to do this .
That &apos;s about all it can do .
Now I &apos;m an optimi@@ st , so I sort of think it &apos;s probably going to do something like that .
If so , that means that what we &apos;re in the middle of right now is a transition .
We &apos;re sort of on this line in a transition from the way the world used to be to some new way that the world is .
And so what I &apos;m trying to ask , what I &apos;ve been asking myself , is what &apos;s this new way that the world is ?
What &apos;s that new state that the world is hea@@ ding toward ?
Because the transition seems very , very confu@@ sing when we &apos;re right in the middle of it .
Now when I was a kid growing up , the future was kind of the year 2000 , and people used to talk about what would happen in the year 2000 .
Now here &apos;s a conference in which people talk about the future , and you notice that the future is still at about the year 2000 .
It &apos;s about as far as we go out .
So in other words , the future has kind of been sh@@ r@@ in@@ king one year per year for my whole lifetime .
Now I think that the reason is because we all feel that something &apos;s happening there .
That transition is happening . We can all sense it .
And we know that it just doesn &apos;t make too much sense to think out 30 , 50 years because everything &apos;s going to be so different that a simple ex@@ tr@@ apo@@ lation of what we &apos;re doing just doesn &apos;t make any sense at all .
So what I would like to talk about is what that could be , what that transition could be that we &apos;re going through .
Now in order to do that I &apos;m going to have to talk about a bunch of stuff that really has nothing to do with technology and computers .
Because I think the only way to understand this is to really step back and take a long time scale look at things .
So the time scale that I would like to look at this on is the time scale of life on Earth .
So I think this picture makes sense if you look at it a few billion years at a time .
So if you go back about two and a half billion years , the Earth was this big , steri@@ le hun@@ k of rock with a lot of chemicals flo@@ ating around on it .
And if you look at the way that the chemicals got organized , we begin to get a pretty good idea of how they do it .
And I think that there &apos;s the@@ ories that are beginning to understand about how it started with RNA , but I &apos;m going to tell a sort of simple story of it , which is that , at that time , there were little dro@@ ps of oil flo@@ ating around with all kinds of different reci@@ pes of chemicals in them .
And some of those dro@@ ps of oil had a particular combination of chemicals in them which caused them to in@@ corporate chemicals from the outside and grow the dro@@ ps of oil .
And those that were like that started to split and divide .
And those were the most pri@@ mi@@ tive forms of cells in a sense , those little dro@@ ps of oil .
But now those dro@@ ps of oil weren &apos;t really alive , as we say it now , because every one of them was a little random reci@@ pe of chemicals .
And every time it divided , they got sort of une@@ qu@@ al divi@@ sion of the chemicals within them .
And so every drop was a little bit different .
In fact , the dro@@ ps that were different in a way that caused them to be better at in@@ corpor@@ ating chemicals around them , grew more and in@@ corpor@@ ated more chemicals and divided more .
So those ten@@ ded to live longer , get ex@@ pressed more .
Now that &apos;s sort of just a very simple chemical form of life , but when things got interesting was when these dro@@ ps learned a trick about abstr@@ action .
Some@@ how by ways that we don &apos;t quite understand , these little dro@@ ps learned to write down information .
They learned to record the information that was the reci@@ pe of the cell onto a particular kind of chemical called DNA .
So in other words , they worked out , in this mind@@ less sort of evolutionary way , a form of writing that let them write down what they were , so that that way of writing it down could get cop@@ i@@ ed .
The amazing thing is that that way of writing seems to have stayed stea@@ dy since it evolved two and a half billion years ago .
In fact the reci@@ pe for us , our genes , is exactly that same code and that same way of writing .
In fact , every living cre@@ ature is written in exactly the same set of letters and the same code .
In fact , one of the things that I did just for a@@ mu@@ se@@ ment pur@@ poses is we can now write things in this code .
And I &apos;ve got here a little 100 micro@@ grams of white po@@ w@@ der , which I try not to let the security people see at air@@ por@@ ts .
But this has in it -- what I did is I took this code -- the code has standard letters that we use for symbo@@ li@@ zing it -- and I wrote my business card onto a piece of DNA and amp@@ li@@ fied it 10 to the 22 times .
So if anyone would like a hundred million cop@@ ies of my business card , I have plenty for everyone in the room , and , in fact , everyone in the world , and it &apos;s right here .
If I had really been a e@@ goti@@ st , I would have put it into a virus and released it in the room .
So what was the next step ?
W@@ ri@@ ting down the DNA was an interesting step .
And that caused these cells -- that kept them happy for another billion years .
But then there was another really interesting step where things became completely different , which is these cells started ex@@ changing and communi@@ cating information , so that they began to get communities of cells .
I don &apos;t know if you know this , but bacteria can actually exchange DNA .
Now that &apos;s why , for instance , antibio@@ tic resistance has evolved .
Some bacteria figured out how to stay away from pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , and it went around sort of creating its little DNA information with other bacteria , and now we have a lot of bacteria that are resi@@ stant to pen@@ ic@@ ill@@ in , because bacteria communicate .
Now what this communication allowed was communities to form that , in some sense , were in the same boat together ; they were sy@@ ner@@ gi@@ stic .
So they survi@@ ved or they failed together , which means that if a community was very successful , all the individuals in that community were repe@@ ated more and they were fa@@ vo@@ red by evolution .
Now the transition point happened when these communities got so close that , in fact , they got together and decided to write down the whole reci@@ pe for the community together on one string of DNA .
And so the next stage that &apos;s interesting in life took about another billion years .
And at that stage , we have multi-@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar communities , communities of lots of different types of cells , working together as a single organ@@ ism .
And in fact , we &apos;re such a multi-@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar community .
We have lots of cells that are not out for themselves anymore .
Your skin cell is really u@@ sel@@ ess without a heart cell , musc@@ le cell , a brain cell and so on .
So these communities began to evolve so that the interesting level on which evolution was taking place was no longer a cell , but a community which we call an organ@@ ism .
Now the next step that happened is within these communities .
These communities of cells , again , began to abstract information .
And they began building very special structures that did nothing but process information within the community .
And those are the ne@@ ural structures .
So neurons are the information processing appar@@ atus that those communities of cells built up .
And in fact , they began to get speci@@ alists in the community and special structures that were responsible for recor@@ ding , understanding , learning information .
And that was the brains and the nervous system of those communities .
And that gave them an evolutionary advantage .
Because at that point , an individual -- learning could happen within the time sp@@ an of a single organ@@ ism , instead of over this evolutionary time sp@@ an .
So an organ@@ ism could , for instance , learn not to eat a certain kind of fru@@ it because it ta@@ sted bad and it got sick last time it ate it .
That could happen within the lifetime of a single organ@@ ism , whereas before they &apos;d built these special information processing structures , that would have had to be learned ev@@ olu@@ tion@@ arily over hundreds of thousands of years by the individuals dying off that ate that kind of fru@@ it .
So that nervous system , the fact that they built these special information structures , tremend@@ ously sp@@ ed up the whole process of evolution .
Because evolution could now happen within an individual .
It could happen in learning time scal@@ es .
But then what happened was the individuals worked out , of course , tr@@ icks of communi@@ cating .
And for example , the most sophisticated version that we &apos;re aware of is human language .
It &apos;s really a pretty amazing invention if you think about it .
Here I have a very complicated , m@@ ess@@ y , confu@@ sed idea in my head .
I &apos;m sitting here making gr@@ un@@ ting sounds basically , and hopefully construc@@ ting a similar m@@ ess@@ y , confu@@ sed idea in your head that be@@ ars some analo@@ gy to it .
But we &apos;re taking something very complicated , turning it into sound , sequ@@ ences of sounds , and producing something very complicated in your brain .
So this allows us now to begin to start func@@ tioning as a single organ@@ ism .
And so , in fact , what we &apos;ve done is we , humanity , have started abstr@@ acting out .
We &apos;re going through the same levels that multi-@@ cel@@ lu@@ lar organisms have gone through -- abstr@@ acting out our methods of recor@@ ding , presen@@ ting , processing information .
So for example , the invention of language was a tiny step in that direction .
T@@ eleph@@ ony , computers , vide@@ ot@@ ap@@ es , C@@ D@@ -@@ R@@ O@@ M@@ s and so on are all our speci@@ alized mechan@@ isms that we &apos;ve now built within our society for hand@@ ling that information .
And it all conn@@ ects us together into something that is much bigger and much faster and able to evolve than what we were before .
So now , evolution can take place on a scale of micros@@ econ@@ ds .
And you saw T@@ y &apos;s little evolutionary example where he sort of did a little bit of evolution on the Con@@ v@@ olution program right before your eyes .
So now we &apos;ve spee@@ ded up the time scal@@ es once again .
So the first steps of the story that I told you about took a billion years a piece .
And the next steps , like nervous systems and brains , took a few hundred million years .
Then the next steps , like language and so on , took less than a million years .
And these next steps , like electron@@ ics , seem to be taking only a few decades .
The process is feeding on itself and becoming , I guess , au@@ to@@ cat@@ aly@@ tic is the word for it -- when something re@@ in@@ forces its rate of change .
The more it changes , the faster it changes .
And I think that that &apos;s what we &apos;re seeing here in this explos@@ ion of curve .
We &apos;re seeing this process feeding back on itself .
Now I design computers for a living , and I know that the mechan@@ isms that I use to design computers would be impossible without recent adv@@ ances in computers .
So right now , what I do is I design objects at such complexity that it &apos;s really impossible for me to design them in the traditional sense .
I don &apos;t know what every transi@@ st@@ or in the connection machine does .
There are billions of them .
Instead , what I do and what the designers at Th@@ in@@ king Ma@@ ch@@ ines do is we think at some level of abstr@@ action and then we hand it to the machine and the machine takes it beyond what we could ever do , much far@@ ther and faster than we could ever do .
And in fact , sometimes it takes it by methods that we don &apos;t quite even understand .
One method that &apos;s particularly interesting that I &apos;ve been using a lot l@@ ately is evolution itself .
So what we do is we put inside the machine a process of evolution that takes place on the micros@@ econ@@ d time scale .
So for example , in the most extreme cases , we can actually evolve a program by starting out with random sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions .
S@@ ay , &quot; Com@@ pu@@ ter , would you please make a hundred million random sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions .
Now would you please run all of those random sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions , run all of those programs , and pick out the ones that came clos@@ est to doing what I wanted . &quot;
So in other words , I define what I wanted .
Let &apos;s say I want to sort numbers , as a simple example I &apos;ve done it with .
So find the programs that come clos@@ est to sor@@ ting numbers .
So of course , random sequ@@ ences of instruc@@ tions are very unlikely to sort numbers , so none of them will really do it .
But one of them , by lu@@ ck , may put two numbers in the right order .
And I say , &quot; Com@@ pu@@ ter , would you please now take the 10 percent of those random sequ@@ ences that did the best job .
Sa@@ ve those . K@@ ill off the rest .
And now let &apos;s re@@ produce the ones that sor@@ ted numbers the best .
And let &apos;s re@@ produce them by a process of re@@ combination analo@@ g@@ ous to sex . &quot;
Take two programs and they produce children by ex@@ changing their sub@@ rou@@ tin@@ es , and the children inher@@ it the tra@@ its of the sub@@ rou@@ tin@@ es of the two programs .
So I &apos;ve got now a new generation of programs that are produced by comb@@ in@@ ations of the programs that did a little bit better job .
S@@ ay , &quot; Please repe@@ at that process . &quot;
S@@ core them again .
In@@ tro@@ duce some mu@@ tations perhaps .
And try that again and do that for another generation .
Well every one of those generations just takes a few milli@@ seconds .
So I can do the equivalent of millions of years of evolution on that within the computer in a few minutes , or in the complicated cases , in a few hours .
At the end of that , I end up with programs that are absolutely perfect at sor@@ ting numbers .
In fact , they are programs that are much more efficient than programs I could have ever written by hand .
Now if I look at those programs , I can &apos;t tell you how they work .
I &apos;ve tried looking at them and telling you how they work .
They &apos;re ob@@ s@@ cure , weird programs .
But they do the job .
And in fact , I know , I &apos;m very confi@@ dent that they do the job because they come from a line of hundreds of thousands of programs that did the job .
In fact , their life dep@@ ended on doing the job .
I was ri@@ ding in a 7@@ 4@@ 7 with Mar@@ v@@ in Min@@ sky once , and he pul@@ ls out this card and says , &quot; Oh look . Look at this .
It says , &apos; This plane has hundreds of thousands of tiny parts working together to make you a safe flight . &apos; Do@@ esn &apos;t that make you feel confi@@ dent ? &quot;
In fact , we know that the engineering process doesn &apos;t work very well when it gets complicated .
So we &apos;re beginning to depend on computers to do a process that &apos;s very different than engineering .
And it lets us produce things of much more complexity than normal engineering lets us produce .
And yet , we don &apos;t quite understand the options of it .
So in a sense , it &apos;s getting ahead of us .
We &apos;re now using those programs to make much faster computers so that we &apos;ll be able to run this process much faster .
So it &apos;s feeding back on itself .
The thing is becoming faster and that &apos;s why I think it seems so confu@@ sing .
Because all of these technologies are feeding back on themselves .
We &apos;re taking off .
And what we are is we &apos;re at a point in time which is analo@@ g@@ ous to when sing@@ le-@@ cel@@ led organisms were turning into multi-@@ cel@@ led organisms .
So we &apos;re the amo@@ e@@ b@@ as and we can &apos;t quite figure out what the hell this thing is we &apos;re creating .
We &apos;re right at that point of transition .
But I think that there really is something coming along after us .
I think it &apos;s very ha@@ u@@ gh@@ ty of us to think that we &apos;re the end product of evolution .
And I think all of us here are a part of producing whatever that next thing is .
So lunch is coming along , and I think I will stop at that point , before I get sel@@ ected out .
So a couple of years ago I started a program to try to get the ro@@ ck@@ star tech and design people to take a year off and work in the one environment that represents pretty much everything they &apos;re supposed to hate ; we have them work in government .
The program is called Co@@ de for America , and it &apos;s a little bit like a Pe@@ ace Cor@@ ps for ge@@ e@@ ks .
We sel@@ ect a few fel@@ lo@@ ws every year and we have them work with city governments .
Instead of sending them off into the Th@@ ird World , we send them into the wil@@ ds of City H@@ all .
And there they make great app@@ s , they work with city sta@@ ff@@ ers .
But really what they &apos;re doing is they &apos;re showing what &apos;s possible with technology today .
So meet Al .
Al is a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant in the city of Boston .
Here it kind of looks like he &apos;s looking for a date , but what he &apos;s really looking for is for someone to sho@@ vel him out when he gets s@@ no@@ wed in , because he knows he &apos;s not very good at fighting fi@@ res when he &apos;s covered in four feet of snow .
Now how did he come to be looking for help in this very unique man@@ ner ?
We had a team of fel@@ lo@@ ws in Boston last year through the Co@@ de for America program .
They were there in Fe@@ bru@@ ary , and it s@@ no@@ wed a lot in Fe@@ bru@@ ary last year .
And they noticed that the city never gets to di@@ gging out these fire hy@@ d@@ rants .
But one fellow in particular , a guy named E@@ ri@@ k Micha@@ el@@ s-@@ O@@ ber , noticed something else , and that &apos;s that citizens are sho@@ v@@ eling out si@@ de@@ walks right in front of these things .
So he did what any good develop@@ er would do , he wrote an app .
It &apos;s a cu@@ te little app where you can adop@@ t a fire hy@@ dr@@ ant .
So you agree to di@@ g it out when it s@@ no@@ ws .
If you do , you get to name it , and he called the first one Al .
And if you don &apos;t , someone can ste@@ al it from you .
So it &apos;s got cu@@ te little game dyna@@ mics on it .
This is a mo@@ dest little app .
It &apos;s probably the sm@@ alle@@ st of the 21 app@@ s that the fel@@ lo@@ ws wrote last year .
But it &apos;s doing something that no other government technology does .
It &apos;s spreading vir@@ ally .
There &apos;s a guy in the I.@@ T@@ . department of the City of Hon@@ olu@@ l@@ u who saw this app and realized that he could use it , not for snow , but to get citizens to adop@@ t t@@ sun@@ ami si@@ ren@@ s .
It &apos;s very important that these t@@ sun@@ ami si@@ ren@@ s work , but people ste@@ al the bat@@ teries out of them .
So he &apos;s getting citizens to check on them .
And then Se@@ attle decided to use it to get citizens to clear out clo@@ gged stor@@ m dra@@ ins .
And Chicago just rol@@ led it out to get people to sign up to sho@@ vel si@@ de@@ walks when it s@@ no@@ ws .
So we now know of nine cities that are planning to use this .
And this has spread just fri@@ c@@ tion@@ lessly , organ@@ ically , naturally .
If you know anything about government technology , you know that this isn &apos;t how it normally goes .
Pro@@ cu@@ ring software usually takes a couple of years .
We had a team that worked on a project in Boston last year that took three people about two and a half months .
It was a way that parents could figure out which were the right public schools for their kids .
We were told after@@ ward that if that had gone through normal chan@@ nels , it would have taken at least two years and it would have cost about two million dollars .
And that &apos;s nothing .
There is one project in the California cour@@ t system right now that so far cost ta@@ x@@ pa@@ yers two billion dollars , and it doesn &apos;t work .
And there are projects like this at every level of government .
So an app that takes a couple of days to write and then sp@@ reads vir@@ ally , that &apos;s sort of a shot across the bow to the institu@@ tion of government .
It suggests how government could work better -- not more like a private company , as many people think it should .
And not even like a tech company , but more like the Internet itself .
And that means per@@ mis@@ sion@@ less , it means open , it means gener@@ ative .
And that &apos;s important .
But what &apos;s more important about this app is that it represents how a new generation is tack@@ ling the problem of government -- not as the problem of an os@@ si@@ fied institu@@ tion , but as a problem of collective action .
And that &apos;s great news , because , it turns out , we &apos;re very good at collective action with digital technology .
Now there &apos;s a very large community of people that are building the tools that we need to do things together effectively .
It &apos;s not just Co@@ de for America fel@@ lo@@ ws , there are hundreds of people all over the country that are standing and writing civi@@ c app@@ s every day in their own communities .
They haven &apos;t given up on government .
They are frustr@@ ated as hell with it , but they &apos;re not compla@@ ining about it , they &apos;re fi@@ x@@ ing it .
And these folks know something that we &apos;ve lost sight of .
And that &apos;s that when you stri@@ p away all your feelings about politics and the line at the D@@ M@@ V and all those other things that we &apos;re really mad about , government is , at its core , in the words of Tim O &apos;@@ Re@@ il@@ ly , &quot; What we do together that we can &apos;t do alone . &quot;
Now a lot of people have given up on government .
And if you &apos;re one of those people , I would ask that you re@@ consider , because things are changing .
Po@@ li@@ tics is not changing ; government is changing .
And because government ultimately der@@ i@@ ves its power from us -- remember &quot; We the people ? &quot; -- how we think about it is going to effect how that change happens .
Now I didn &apos;t know very much about government when I started this program .
And like a lot of people , I thought government was basically about getting people elec@@ ted to office .
Well after two years , I &apos;ve come to the conclusion that , especially local government , is about op@@ os@@ su@@ ms .
This is the call center for the services and information line .
It &apos;s generally where you will get if you call 3@@ 11 in your city .
If you should ever have the chance to staff your city &apos;s call center , as our fellow Scott S@@ il@@ ver@@ man did as part of the program -- in fact , they all do that -- you will find that people call government with a very wide range of issues , including having an op@@ os@@ sum stuck in your house .
So Scott gets this call .
He types &quot; O@@ pos@@ sum &quot; into this official knowledge base .
He doesn &apos;t really come up with anything . He starts with animal control .
And finally , he says , &quot; Look , can you just open all the doors to your house and play music really loud and see if the thing leaves ? &quot;
So that worked . So boo@@ ya for Scott .
But that wasn &apos;t the end of the op@@ os@@ su@@ ms .
Boston doesn &apos;t just have a call center .
It has an app , a Web and mobile app , called Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Con@@ n@@ ect .
Now we didn &apos;t write this app .
This is the work of the very smart people at the O@@ ffi@@ ce of New U@@ r@@ ban Me@@ chan@@ ics in Boston .
So one day -- this is an actual report -- this came in : &quot; O@@ pos@@ sum in my tr@@ ash@@ can . Can &apos;t tell if it &apos;s dead .
How do I get this removed ? &quot;
But what happens with Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Con@@ n@@ ect is different .
So Scott was speaking person@@ -@@ to-@@ person .
But on Ci@@ tiz@@ ens Con@@ n@@ ect everything is public , so everybody can see this .
And in this case , a neighb@@ or saw it .
And the next report we got said , &quot; I walked over to this location , found the tr@@ ash@@ can behind the house .
O@@ pos@@ sum ? Ch@@ eck . Li@@ ving ? Y@@ ep .
Tur@@ ned tr@@ ash@@ can on its side . Wal@@ ked home .
Goo@@ d@@ night sweet op@@ os@@ sum . &quot;
Pre@@ t@@ ty simple .
So this is great . This is the digital meeting the physical .
And it &apos;s also a great example of government getting in on the crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing game .
But it &apos;s also a great example of government as a platform .
And I don &apos;t mean necessarily a technological definition of platform here .
I &apos;m just talking about a platform for people to help themselves and to help others .
So one citiz@@ en helped another citiz@@ en , but government played a key role here .
It connected those two people .
And it could have connected them with government services if they &apos;d been needed , but a neighb@@ or is a far better and cheaper alternative to government services .
When one neighb@@ or helps another , we streng@@ then our communities .
We call animal control , it just costs a lot of money .
Now one of the important things we need to think about government is that it &apos;s not the same thing as politics .
And most people get that , but they think that one is the input to the other .
That our input to the system of government is vo@@ ting .
Now how many times have we elec@@ ted a political leader -- and sometimes we spend a lot of energy getting a new political leader elec@@ ted -- and then we sit back and we expect government to refl@@ ect our values and meet our needs , and then not that much changes ?
That &apos;s because government is like a vast ocean and politics is the six@@ -@@ inch layer on top .
And what &apos;s under that is what we call bu@@ re@@ au@@ cracy .
And we say that word with such con@@ temp@@ t .
But it &apos;s that con@@ temp@@ t that keeps this thing that we own and we pay for as something that &apos;s working against us , this other thing , and then we &apos;re dise@@ mp@@ o@@ wering ourselves .
People seem to think politics is se@@ xy .
If we want this institu@@ tion to work for us , we &apos;re going to have to make bu@@ re@@ au@@ cracy se@@ xy .
Because that &apos;s where the real work of government happens .
We have to engage with the mach@@ in@@ ery of government .
So that &apos;s Oc@@ cu@@ py@@ the@@ S@@ E@@ C movement has done .
Have you seen these guys ?
It &apos;s a group of concerned citizens that have written a very deta@@ iled 3@@ 25@@ -@@ page report that &apos;s a response to the S@@ E@@ C &apos;s re@@ quest for com@@ ment on the Fin@@ an@@ cial Re@@ form Bill .
That &apos;s not being poli@@ tically active , that &apos;s being bu@@ re@@ au@@ cra@@ tically active .
Now for those of us who &apos;ve given up on government , it &apos;s time that we asked ourselves about the world that we want to leave for our children .
You have to see the enormous challenges that they &apos;re going to face .
Do we really think we &apos;re going to get where we need to go without fi@@ x@@ ing the one institu@@ tion that can act on be@@ half of all of us ?
We can &apos;t do without government , but we do need it to be more effective .
The good news is that technology is making it possible to fundamentally re@@ frame the function of government in a way that can actually scale by streng@@ th@@ ening civil society .
And there &apos;s a generation out there that &apos;s grown up on the Internet , and they know that it &apos;s not that hard to do things together , you just have to architect the systems the right way .
Now the average age of our fel@@ lo@@ ws is 28 , so I am , beg@@ ru@@ d@@ gi@@ ngly , almost a generation older than most of them .
This is a generation that &apos;s grown up taking their voices pretty much for granted .
They &apos;re not fighting that battle that we &apos;re all fighting about who gets to speak ; they all get to speak .
They can express their opinion on any channel at any time , and they do .
So when they &apos;re faced with the problem of government , they don &apos;t care as much about using their voices .
They &apos;re using their hands .
They &apos;re using their hands to write applications that make government work better .
And those applications let us use our hands to make our communities better .
That could be sho@@ v@@ eling out a hy@@ dr@@ ant , pul@@ ling a we@@ ed , turning over a gar@@ b@@ age can with an op@@ os@@ sum in it .
And certainly , we could have been sho@@ v@@ eling out those fire hy@@ d@@ rants all along , and many people do .
But these app@@ s are like little digital remin@@ ders that we &apos;re not just consumers , and we &apos;re not just consumers of government , putting in our ta@@ xes and getting back services .
We &apos;re more than that , we &apos;re citizens .
And we &apos;re not going to fix government until we fix citiz@@ en@@ ship .
So the question I have for all of you here : When it comes to the big , important things that we need to do together , all of us together , are we just going to be a crowd of voices , or are we also going to be a crowd of hands ?
Thank you .
I would like to talk to you about why many e-@@ health projects fail .
And I really think that the most important thing of it is that we stopped listening to patients .
And one of the things we did at R@@ ad@@ b@@ oud University is we ap@@ pointed a chi@@ ef listening offi@@ cer .
Not in a very scientific way -- she puts up a little cup of coffee or cup of tea and asks patients , family , rela@@ tives , &quot; What &apos;s up ?
How could we help you ? &quot;
And we think , we like to think , that this is one of the major problems why all -- maybe not all -- but most of the e-@@ health projects fail , since we stopped listening .
This is my Wi@@ F@@ i scale . It &apos;s a very simple thing .
It &apos;s got one kno@@ b , on / off .
And every morning I hop on it .
And yes , I &apos;ve got a challenge , as you might see .
And I put my challenge on 95 kg .
But the thing is that it &apos;s made this simple that whenever I hop on , it sen@@ ds my data through Google Health as well .
And it &apos;s collected by my general practi@@ tion@@ er as well , so he can see what &apos;s my problem in weight , not on the very moment that I need car@@ dio@@ logic support or something like it , but also looking back@@ ward .
But there &apos;s another thing .
As some of you might know , I &apos;ve got more than 4,000 follo@@ wers on Twitter .
So every morning I hop on my Wi@@ F@@ i scale and before I &apos;m in my car , people start talking to me , &quot; I think you need a light lunch today , Lu@@ ci@@ en . &quot;
But that &apos;s the nic@@ est thing that could happen , since this is pe@@ er pressure , pe@@ er pressure used to help patients -- since this could be used for obesity , it could be used to stop smo@@ king in patients .
But on the other hand , it also could be used to get people from out of their chairs and try to work together in some kind of gam@@ ing activity to get more control of their health .
As of next week , it will soon be available .
There will be this little blood pressure meter connected to an iPhone or something or other .
And people will be able , from their homes , to take their blood pressure , send it into their doctor and eventually share it with others , for instance , for over a hundred dollars .
And this is the point where patients get into position and can collect , not only their own control again , be cap@@ tain of their own ship , but also can help us in health care due to the challenges that we face , like health care cost explos@@ ion , doub@@ led demand and things like that .
Ma@@ ke techniques that are easy to use and start with this to embrace patients in the team .
And you can do this with techniques like this , but also by crow@@ d-@@ sour@@ cing .
And one of the things we did I would like to share with you introduced by a little video .
We &apos;ve all got navi@@ gation contr@@ ols in our car .
We maybe even &#91; have &#93; it in our cell@@ phone .
We know perfectly where all the A@@ T@@ M@@ s are about the city of Ma@@ as@@ tri@@ ch@@ t .
The other thing is we know where all the gas stations are .
And sure , we could find fast food cha@@ ins .
But where would be the near@@ est A@@ ED to help this patient ?
We asked around and nobody knew .
Nobody knew where the near@@ est life-@@ saving A@@ ED was to be ob@@ ta@@ ined right now .
So what we did , we crow@@ d@@ sour@@ ced The Ne@@ ther@@ lands .
We set up a website and asked the crowd , &quot; If you see an A@@ ED , please sub@@ mit it , tell us where it is , tell us when it &apos;s open , &quot; since sometimes in office hours sometimes it &apos;s closed , of course .
And over 10,000 A@@ ED@@ s already in The Ne@@ ther@@ lands already have been sub@@ mit@@ ted .
The next step we took was to find the applications for it .
And we built an iP@@ ad application .
We made an application for La@@ y@@ ar , au@@ g@@ mented reality , to find these A@@ ED@@ s .
And whenever you are in a city like Ma@@ as@@ tri@@ ch@@ t and somebody collap@@ ses , you can use your iPhone , and within the next weeks also run your Microsoft cell@@ phone , to find the near@@ est A@@ ED which can save lives .
And as of today , we would like to introduce this , not only as A@@ ED@@ 4@@ E@@ U , which is what the product is called , but also A@@ ED@@ 4@@ U@@ S .
And we would like to start this on a worldwide level .
And &#91; we &apos;re &#93; asking all of our colleagues in the rest of the world , colleagu@@ e univer@@ sities , to help us to find and work and act like a hu@@ b to crow@@ d-@@ source all these A@@ ED@@ s all around the world .
That whenever you &apos;re on ho@@ li@@ day and somebody collap@@ ses , might it be your own relative or someone just in front of you , you can find this .
The other thing we would like to ask is of companies also all over the world that will be able to help us v@@ ali@@ date these A@@ ED@@ s .
These might be cou@@ ri@@ er services or c@@ able guys for instance , just to see whether the A@@ ED that &apos;s sub@@ mit@@ ted still is in place .
So please help us on this one and try to make not only health a little bit better , but take control of it .
Thank you .
I &apos;m here to share my photography .
Or is it photography ?
Because , of course , this is a photograph that you can &apos;t take with your camera .
Yet , my interest in photography started as I got my first digital camera at the age of 15 .
It mi@@ xed with my earlier passion for drawing , but it was a bit different , because using the camera , the process was in the planning instead .
And when you take a photograph with a camera , the process ends when you press the tri@@ gger .
So to me it felt like photography was more about being at the right place and the right time .
I felt like anyone could do that .
So I wanted to create something different , something where the process starts when you press the tri@@ gger .
Phot@@ os like this : construction going on along a busy road .
But it has an unexpected tw@@ ist .
And despite that , it re@@ tains a level of real@@ ism .
Or photos like these -- both dark and col@@ or@@ ful , but all with a common goal of re@@ ta@@ ining the level of real@@ ism .
When I say real@@ ism , I mean phot@@ o-@@ real@@ ism .
Because , of course , it &apos;s not something you can capture really , but I always want it to look like it could have been captured somehow as a photograph .
Phot@@ os where you will need a bri@@ ef moment to think to figure out the trick .
So it &apos;s more about cap@@ turing an idea than about cap@@ turing a moment really .
But what &apos;s the trick that makes it look real@@ istic ?
Is it something about the details or the colors ?
Is it something about the light ?
What creates the illusion ?
Sometimes the perspective is the illusion .
But in the end , it comes down to how we interpre@@ t the world and how it can be realized on a two-@@ dimensional surface .
It &apos;s not really what is real@@ istic , it &apos;s what we think looks real@@ istic really .
So I think the ba@@ si@@ cs are quite simple .
I just see it as a puzzle of reality where you can take different pieces of reality and put it together to create alter@@ n@@ ate reality .
And let me show you a simple example .
Here we have three perfectly imag@@ in@@ able physical objects , something we all can relate to living in a three-dimensional world .
But combined in a certain way , they can create something that still looks three-dimensional , like it could exist .
But at the same time , we know it can &apos;t .
So we trick our brains , because our brain simply doesn &apos;t accept the fact that it doesn &apos;t really make sense .
And I see the same process with comb@@ ining photographs .
It &apos;s just really about comb@@ ining different reali@@ ties .
So the things that make a photograph look real@@ istic , I think it &apos;s the things that we don &apos;t even think about , the things all around us in our daily lives .
But when comb@@ ining photographs , this is really important to consider , because otherwise it just looks wrong somehow .
So I would like to say that there are three simple rules to follow to achieve a real@@ istic result .
As you can see , these images aren &apos;t really special .
But combined , they can create something like this .
So the first rule is that photos combined should have the same perspective .
Secon@@ dly , photos combined should have the same type of light .
And these two images both ful@@ fill these two requi@@ rements -- shot at the same height and in the same type of light .
The third one is about making it impossible to di@@ sti@@ ngu@@ ish where the different images begin and end by making it se@@ am@@ less .
Ma@@ ke it impossible to say how the image actually was compos@@ ed .
So by mat@@ ching color , contrast and bri@@ ght@@ ness in the borders between the different images , ad@@ ding photograp@@ hic def@@ ects like dep@@ th of field , des@@ atur@@ ated colors and noise , we er@@ ase the borders between the different images and make it look like one single image , despite the fact that one image can con@@ tain hundreds of la@@ yers basically .
So here &apos;s another example .
One might think that this is just an image of a landscape and the lower part is what &apos;s manipu@@ lated .
But this image is actually entirely compos@@ ed of photographs from different lo@@ cations .
I personally think that it &apos;s easier to actually create a place than to find a place , because then you don &apos;t need to comprom@@ ise with the ideas in your head .
But it does require a lot of planning .
And getting this idea during winter , I knew that I had several months to plan it , to find the different lo@@ cations for the pieces of the puzzle basically .
So for example , the fish was captured on a fishing trip .
The sho@@ res are from a different location .
The underwater part was captured in a stone p@@ it .
And yeah , I even turned the house on top of the island red to make it look more Swe@@ dish .
So to achieve a real@@ istic result , I think it comes down to planning .
It always starts with a s@@ ket@@ ch , an idea .
Then it &apos;s about comb@@ ining the different photographs .
And here every piece is very well plan@@ ned .
And if you do a good job cap@@ turing the photos , the result can be quite beautiful and also quite real@@ istic .
So all the tools are out there , and the only thing that limits us is our imagination .
Thank you .
This may sound strange , but I &apos;m a big fan of the concrete block .
The first concrete blocks were manufac@@ tured in 18@@ 6@@ 8 with a very simple idea : mo@@ du@@ les made of ce@@ ment of a fixed measu@@ rement that fit together .
Very quickly concrete blocks became the mos@@ t-@@ used construction unit in the world .
They en@@ abled us to to build things that were larger than us , buildings , bri@@ dges , one bri@@ ck at a time .
E@@ ss@@ entially concrete blocks had become the building block of our time .
Al@@ most a hundred years later in 194@@ 7 , L@@ E@@ G@@ O came up with this .
It was called the A@@ ut@@ om@@ a@@ tic B@@ in@@ ding Bri@@ ck .
And in a few short years , L@@ E@@ G@@ O bri@@ cks took place in every house@@ hold .
It &apos;s es@@ tim@@ ated that over 400 billion bri@@ cks have been produced -- or 75 bri@@ cks for every person on the planet .
You don &apos;t have to be an engineer to make beautiful houses , beautiful bri@@ dges , beautiful buildings .
L@@ E@@ G@@ O made it accessible .
L@@ E@@ G@@ O has essentially taken the concrete block , the building block of the world , and made it into the building block of our imagination .
Me@@ an@@ while the exact same year , at Bell L@@ ab@@ s the next revolution was about to be announ@@ ced , the next building block .
The transi@@ st@@ or was a small plastic unit that would take us from a world of sta@@ tic bri@@ cks p@@ iled on top of each other to a world where everything was interactive .
Like the concrete block , the transi@@ st@@ or allows you to build much larger , more complex circu@@ its , one bri@@ ck at a time .
But there &apos;s a main difference : The transi@@ st@@ or was only for experts .
I personally don &apos;t accept this , that the building block of our time is re@@ served for experts , so I decided to change that .
E@@ ight years ago when I was at the Me@@ dia La@@ b , I started exploring this idea of how to put the power of engineers in the hands of artists and designers .
A few years ago I started developing lit@@ tle@@ B@@ its .
Let me show you how they work .
L@@ it@@ tle@@ B@@ its are electron@@ ic mo@@ du@@ les with each one specific function .
They &apos;re pre-@@ engine@@ ered to be light , sound , mot@@ ors and sensors .
And the best part about it is they sna@@ p together with magne@@ ts .
So you can &apos;t put them the wrong way .
The bri@@ cks are col@@ or@@ -@@ co@@ ded .
Green is out@@ put , blue is power , p@@ ink is input and or@@ ange is wire .
So all you need to do is sna@@ p a blue to a green and very quickly you can start making larger circu@@ its .
You put a blue to a green , you can make light .
You can put a kno@@ b in between and now you &apos;ve made a little di@@ m@@ mer .
S@@ wit@@ ch out the kno@@ b for a pul@@ se mo@@ du@@ le , which is here , and now you &apos;ve made a little blin@@ ker .
Ad@@ d this bu@@ zz@@ er for some extra p@@ unch and you &apos;ve created a noise machine .
I &apos;m going to stop that .
So beyond simple play , lit@@ tle@@ B@@ its are actually pretty powerful .
Instead of having to program , to wire , to sol@@ der , lit@@ tle@@ B@@ its allow you to program using very simple intuitive gestu@@ res .
So to make this b@@ link faster or s@@ lower , you would just turn this kno@@ b and basically make it pul@@ se faster or s@@ lower .
The idea behind lit@@ tle@@ B@@ its is that it &apos;s a growing library .
We want to make every single interaction in the world into a read@@ y-@@ to-@@ use bri@@ ck .
Li@@ ghts , sounds , solar pan@@ els , mot@@ ors -- everything should be accessible .
We &apos;ve been giving lit@@ tle@@ B@@ its to kids and seeing them play with them .
And it &apos;s been an incredible experience .
The nic@@ est thing is how they start to understand the electron@@ ics around them from everyday that they don &apos;t learn at schools .
For example , how a ni@@ ght@@ light works , or why an elev@@ ator door sta@@ ys open , or how an iP@@ od respon@@ ds to touch .
We &apos;ve also been taking lit@@ tle@@ B@@ its to design schools .
So for example , we &apos;ve had designers with no experience with electron@@ ics what@@ so@@ ever start to play with lit@@ tle@@ B@@ its as a material .
Here you see , with felt and paper water bot@@ tles , we have Geor@@ die making ...
A few weeks ago we took lit@@ tle@@ B@@ its to R@@ I@@ S@@ D and gave them to some designers with no experience in engineering what@@ so@@ ever -- just car@@ d@@ board , wood and paper -- and told them &quot; Ma@@ ke something . &quot;
Here &apos;s an example of a project they made , a mo@@ tion-@@ activ@@ ated con@@ fe@@ t@@ ti can@@ on ball .
But wait , this is actually my favorite project .
It &apos;s a lob@@ ster made of play@@ d@@ ough that &apos;s afraid of the dark .
To these non-@@ engineers , lit@@ tle@@ B@@ its became another material , electron@@ ics became just another material .
And we want to make this material accessible to everyone .
So lit@@ tle@@ B@@ its is open-source .
You can go on the website , down@@ load all the design fil@@ es , make them yourself .
We want to encourage a world of cre@@ ators , of inven@@ tors , of contribu@@ tors , because this world that we live in , this interactive world , is ours .
So go ahead and start inven@@ ting .
Thank you .
In the 198@@ 0s in the communi@@ st Eastern Germany , if you ow@@ ned a ty@@ pe@@ writer , you had to regi@@ ster it with the government .
You had to regi@@ ster a sample sheet of text out of the ty@@ pe@@ writer .
And this was done so the government could track where text was coming from .
If they found a paper which had the wrong kind of thought , they could track down who created that thought .
And we in the West couldn &apos;t understand how anybody could do this , how much this would re@@ strict freedom of speech .
We would never do that in our own countries .
But today in 2011 , if you go and buy a color laser prin@@ ter from any major laser prin@@ ter manufac@@ tu@@ rer and print a page , that page will end up having s@@ light yellow dots printed on every single page in a pattern which makes the page unique to you and to your prin@@ ter .
This is happening to us today .
And nobody seems to be making a fu@@ ss about it .
And this is an example of the ways that our own governments are using technology against us , the citizens .
And this is one of the main three sources of online problems today .
If we take a look at what &apos;s really happening in the online world , we can group the attacks based on the att@@ ack@@ ers .
We have three main groups .
We have online criminals .
Like here , we have Mr. Di@@ mi@@ try G@@ olu@@ bo@@ v from the city of Ki@@ e@@ v in U@@ k@@ ra@@ ine .
And the mo@@ tives of online criminals are very easy to understand .
These guys make money .
They use online attacks to make lots of money , and lots and lots of it .
We actually have several cases of milli@@ on@@ ai@@ res online , mul@@ tim@@ illi@@ on@@ ai@@ res , who made money with their attacks .
Here &apos;s V@@ la@@ di@@ mi@@ r T@@ sa@@ st@@ sin form T@@ art@@ u in E@@ st@@ on@@ ia .
This is Al@@ f@@ red G@@ on@@ z@@ al@@ e@@ z .
This is Stephen Wat@@ t .
This is B@@ j@@ or@@ n Sun@@ d@@ in .
This is Mat@@ the@@ w An@@ der@@ son , T@@ ari@@ q Al@@ -@@ Da@@ our and so on and so on .
These guys make their fortun@@ es online , but they make it through the illegal means of using things like ban@@ king tro@@ j@@ ans to ste@@ al money from our bank accoun@@ ts while we do online ban@@ king , or with key@@ lo@@ gg@@ ers to collect our credit card information while we are doing online shopping from an infected computer .
The U.S. Sec@@ re@@ t Ser@@ vice , two months ago , fro@@ ze the S@@ wi@@ ss bank account of Mr. Sam Ja@@ in right here , and that bank account had 14@@ .@@ 9 million U.S. dollars on it when it was frozen .
Mr. Ja@@ in himself is on the lo@@ ose ; nobody knows where he is .
And I claim it &apos;s already today that it &apos;s more likely for any of us to become the vic@@ tim of a crime online than here in the real world .
And it &apos;s very obvious that this is only going to get worse .
In the future , the majority of crime will be happening online .
The second major group of att@@ ack@@ ers that we are watching today are not motiv@@ ated by money .
They &apos;re motiv@@ ated by something else -- motiv@@ ated by prot@@ ests , motiv@@ ated by an opinion , motiv@@ ated by the laugh@@ s .
G@@ rou@@ ps like An@@ ony@@ mous have ris@@ en up over the last 12 months and have become a major player in the field of online attacks .
So those are the three main att@@ ack@@ ers : criminals who do it for the money , hack@@ ti@@ vi@@ sts like An@@ ony@@ mous doing it for the prot@@ est , but then the last group are nation states , governments doing the attacks .
And then we look at cases like what happened in Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
This is a pri@@ me example of what happens when governments attack against their own citizens .
Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ er@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate Au@@ th@@ ority from The Ne@@ ther@@ lands -- or actually , it was .
It was running into ban@@ k@@ rup@@ t@@ cy last fall because they were h@@ acked into .
Some@@ body broke in and they h@@ acked it th@@ or@@ ou@@ gh@@ ly .
And I asked last week in a meeting with D@@ ut@@ ch government represen@@ ta@@ tives , I asked one of the leaders of the team whether he found pla@@ u@@ sible that people died because of the Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar h@@ ack .
And his answer was yes .
So how do people die as the result of a h@@ ack like this ?
Well Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar is a C@@ .@@ A.
They sell cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
What do you do with cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates ?
Well you need a cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ate if you have a website that has h@@ t@@ t@@ ps , S@@ S@@ L en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted services , services like G@@ mail .
Now we all , or a big part of us , use G@@ mail or one of their competi@@ tors , but these services are especially popular in tot@@ al@@ itarian states like Iran , where dis@@ si@@ dents use foreign services like G@@ mail because they know they are more tru@@ st@@ wor@@ thy than the local services and they are en@@ cr@@ yp@@ ted over S@@ S@@ L connections , so the local government can &apos;t s@@ no@@ o@@ p on their discu@@ ssions .
Ex@@ cept they can if they h@@ ack into a foreign C@@ .@@ A.
and issue ro@@ gue cer@@ ti@@ fic@@ ates .
And this is exactly what happened with the case of Di@@ gi@@ N@@ ot@@ ar .
What about Arab S@@ pr@@ ing and things that have been happening , for example , in Egypt ?
Well in Egypt , the ri@@ ot@@ ers lo@@ ot@@ ed the head@@ quar@@ ters of the Egy@@ p@@ tian secret police in A@@ pri@@ l 2011 , and when they were loo@@ ting the building they found lots of papers .
A@@ mong those papers , was this b@@ in@@ der enti@@ tled &quot; F@@ IN@@ F@@ I@@ S@@ H@@ E@@ R . &quot;
And within that b@@ in@@ der were notes from a company based in Germany which had sold the Egy@@ p@@ tian government a set of tools for inter@@ cep@@ ting -- and in very large scale -- all the communication of the citizens of the country .
They had sold this tool for 2@@ 8@@ 0,000 Euro@@ s to the Egy@@ p@@ tian government .
The company head@@ quar@@ ters are right here .
So Western governments are providing tot@@ al@@ itarian governments with tools to do this against their own citizens .
But Western governments are doing it to themselves as well .
For example , in Germany , just a couple of weeks ago the so-@@ called State T@@ ro@@ j@@ an was found , which was a tro@@ j@@ an used by German government offi@@ cials to investi@@ gate their own citizens .
If you are a susp@@ ect in a criminal case , well it &apos;s pretty obvious , your phone will be t@@ apped .
But today , it goes beyond that .
They will ta@@ p your Internet connection .
They will even use tools like State T@@ ro@@ j@@ an to inf@@ ect your computer with a tro@@ j@@ an , which en@@ ables them to watch all your communication , to listen to your online discu@@ ssions , to collect your passwords .
Now when we think deeper about things like these , the obvious response from people should be that , &quot; Okay , that sounds bad , but that doesn &apos;t really affect me because I &apos;m a legal citiz@@ en .
Why should I worry ?
Because I have nothing to hide . &quot;
And this is an argument , which doesn &apos;t make sense .
Pri@@ v@@ acy is impli@@ ed .
Pri@@ v@@ acy is not up for discussion .
This is not a question between privacy against security .
It &apos;s a question of freedom against control .
And while we might trust our governments right now , right here in 2011 , any right we give away will be given away for good .
And do we trust , do we blin@@ dly trust , any future government , a government we might have 50 years from now ?
And these are the questions that we have to worry about for the next 50 years .
